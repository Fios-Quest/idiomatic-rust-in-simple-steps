<p>Welcome to IRISS 👁️🦀</p>
<p>Rust has a reputation of being difficult to learn, certainly it was when I learned back in 2017. While its true that
there remain some rough edges, the language is now easier to pick up than ever, and in many ways is much easier than
a lot of more established languages.</p>
<p>The goal of this series is to help you go from no knowledge of Rust to understanding how Rust is written as quickly as
possible.</p>
<p>This book is the written version of a companion 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW2L8KbM0O7aRi_Bt4YE1JuW9EdMs0ztR" title="" target="_blank">YouTube series</a> (coming soon)</p>
<p>If you spot a problem with this guide (I’m only human 😅), please file an Issue or even a PR on the
<a href="https://github.com/Gisleburt/idiomatic-rust-in-simple-steps" title="" target="_blank">project repository</a> and I will be incredibly grateful.
I certainly don’t know <em>everything</em> about Rust and look forward to learning new things throughout this project.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you should start by <a href="./introduction/why.html">deciding if Rust is definitely the language for you</a>, and
what <a href="./introduction/resources.html">other learning resources</a> are available.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-or-why-not"><a class="header" href="#why-or-why-not">Why or Why Not</a></h1>
<ol>
<li><a href="introduction/why.html#why-rust">Why Rust</a></li>
<li><a href="introduction/why.html#why-not-rust">Why not Rust</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-rust"><a class="header" href="#why-rust">Why Rust</a></h2>
<p>I could tell you that it’s a “blazingly fast” language, that holds your hand and helps reduce bugs, that its first party
tooling is second to none, that it has a mature ecosystem and an amazing community. These are all good reasons to
consider using Rust for any personal or professional project. There is, however, in my mind, a singular reason everyone
should consider learning Rust:</p>
<p><strong>Because its fun</strong></p>
<p>Seriously, Rust is my happy place. Sure it has its frustrations like any language, but when I work with Rust I <em>feel</em>
smart, I have less horrible surprises, and I have a lot of confidence that my code will “just work”, that I won’t need
to come back to fix bugs and if I do, I will be able to quickly understand old code, write new tests and fix any
problems.</p>
<p>And, I’m not alone, since its 1.0 release Rust has been Stack Overflows “most loved” (now “most admired”) language eight
years in a row. This isn’t derived from fanatics like me just saying “its great” but is the percentage of people who
used the language this year, that still want to use it next year.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-rust"><a class="header" href="#why-not-rust">Why not Rust</a></h2>
<p>As much as I love Rust, there is a reason it may not be the language for you… and it’s a <em>big</em> one.</p>
<p>If you are specifically looking to learn a language to get a job (and you’re not interested in Blockchain) Rust is not
going to be a good language… for now. The irony of “professional Rust” is that Rust engineers think there are no Rust
employers, and Rust employers think there are no Rust engineers <em>because</em> very few of us are interested in Blockchain
technologies.</p>
<p>That said, things have been slowly changing. More businesses are picking it up due to its low cost to write, run and
maintain. The main cost to adopting Rust remains the cost of training people, but there are more and more of us out
there and perhaps 2024 will finally be the tipping point. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, right now, if you’re looking for a job,
<a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-language-prof" title="" target="_blank">better languages to learn</a> would be
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org" title="" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> or <a href="https://www.python.org" title="" target="_blank">Python</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="other-learning-resources"><a class="header" href="#other-learning-resources">Other Learning Resources</a></h1>
<p>Its worth mentioning that there are many other Rust learning resources out there, so if this guide ends up not working
out for you, or you’re looking to supplement it with other sources, these are in my mind, the (other) best ways to learn
the Rust.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="introduction/resources.html#the-official-book">The official book</a></li>
<li><a href="introduction/resources.html#rustlings">Rustlings</a></li>
<li><a href="introduction/resources.html#rust-by-example">Rust by Example</a></li>

</ol>
<h2 id="the-official-book"><a class="header" href="#the-official-book">The official book</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/" title="" target="_blank">The Rust Programming Language</a> book is the official way to learn, and will be the
most complete guide. This is how I learned the language way back in 2017 and its gotten significantly better since then.
The main difference between the official book and this guide is that the official book focuses on teaching you how the
language works, while this guide is focused on how the language is written, only looping back to how the language works
to explain why we write it that way. This guide tries to follow a similar path to the official book and to Rustlings,
see below, so it should be easy to jump between them.</p>
<h2 id="rustlings"><a class="header" href="#rustlings">Rustlings</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/" title="" target="_blank">Rustlings</a> is a “learn by doing” guide to Rust. It works by giving you
specific exercises to help you understand the language a bit at a time.</p>
<p>The gamification of the course makes it really fun, so I still use Rustlings to help keep myself sharp.</p>
<h2 id="rust-by-example"><a class="header" href="#rust-by-example">Rust by Example</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/" title="" target="_blank">Rust by Example</a> does exactly what it says on the tin. It focuses on
the implementation of the Rust language.</p>
<p>This is great to quickly look things up if you know what you want to know, however, there’s some minor
pseudo-anti-patterns here that if you don’t already know are anti-patterns, you might be tempted to copy-paste. Don’t
worry though, we’ll cover these here but also tools like Clippy (which we’ll also cover) will be quick to point them
out.</p>
<h2 id="idiomatic-rust-in-simple-steps-1"><a class="header" href="#idiomatic-rust-in-simple-steps-1">Idiomatic Rust in Simple Steps</a></h2>
<p>So, why use IRISS if there are these other great resources?</p>
<p>Idiomatic Rust in Simple Steps lines up nicely with these other resources and can supplement them or vice versa. While
the other resources focus on simply learning the language, IRISS focuses on how and why we write the language the way
we do. This might seem like the same thing, but here we’ll ramp up on idioms quickly so that you can understand other
peoples code as well as write code that other people can understand.</p>
<p>This matters!</p>
<p>My biggest hot take of the software industry is that: Software engineers are not paid to write code, they’re paid to
solve problems.</p>
<p>The best engineers I’ve worked with have solved problems without writing a single line of code, and the cheapest code to
maintain is the code you didn’t write. Beyond this though, solving problems, even with code, takes understanding and
collaboration. If when you join a team you already understand why they write code the way they do, you’re going to
become productive much faster.</p>

<h2 id="mac-and-linux"><a class="header" href="#mac-and-linux">Mac and Linux</a></h2>
<p>Before you begin, you need to make sure you have the appropriate build tools.</p>
<p>For Mac, make sure to run <code>xcode-select install</code></p>
<p>For Linux, you need to install gcc via your package manage, for example, on a Raspberry Pi, you might do 
<code>sudo apt install gcc</code></p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://rustup.rs" title="" target="_blank">https://rustup.rs</a>, copy the command displayed there into your terminal.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/images/rustup-mac.png" alt="Rustup Mac / Linux" /></p>
<p>You will be given the option for customizing the installation, but we don’t need to do that for now</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# [other information about the install appears here]

Current installation options:


   default host triple: x86_64-apple-darwin
     default toolchain: stable (default)
               profile: default
  modify PATH variable: yes

1) Proceed with installation (default)
2) Customize installation
3) Cancel installation
&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Choose 1 and wait for installation to complete. To immediately use Rust’s tools now, you will need to run the command it
tells you to run at the end of the installer, however, you should only need to do this once as the installer makes the
changes necessary for new terminal sessions to pick up on the changes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ source &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can check whether everything has installed properly by running <code>cargo version</code> and you should see something
like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo version
cargo 1.75.0 (1d8b05cdd 2023-11-20)
</code></pre>
<p>Cargo is the main tool we’ll use to build and work with Rust, you will need at least version <code>1.75</code> for this tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="windows"><a class="header" href="#windows">Windows</a></h2>
<p>Installing Rust on Windows is a bit more challenging, but you’ve got this, I believe in you.</p>
<p>All the important differences for Windows are explained on <a href="https://rustup.rs" title="" target="_blank">rustup.rs</a>, however, I personally
struggled a bit with this, so I’m laying it out here in my own words.</p>
<h3 id="windows-build-tools"><a class="header" href="#windows-build-tools">Windows Build Tools</a></h3>
<p>The first thing we’re going to need are some Microsoft build tools. </p>
<p>Head to <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/" title="" target="_blank">https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/</a> and download the 
community edition.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/windows-visual-studio-community.png" alt="windows-visual-studio-community.png" /></p>
<p>The installer is the gateway to a huge number of tools and software, but we only need two things.</p>
<p>Click through to the Individual Components tab, and search for the following: <code>C++ x64/x86 build tools</code></p>
<p>Select the latest version.</p>
<p>Next search for: <code>Windows SDK</code></p>
<p>Select the latest version of the SDK for your version of Windows.</p>
<p>Finally, click install. You may get a prompt asking if you’d like to continue without workloads, which you do,
so continue.</p>
<p>The installation itself can take a while so grab a tea or something ☕</p>
<h3 id="rustup"><a class="header" href="#rustup">Rustup</a></h3>
<p>Once the Windows build tools are installed, head back to <a href="https://rustup.rs" title="" target="_blank">rustup.rs</a> and download <code>rustup-init.exe</code>.
Running this will install the tools we need.</p>
<p>Choose the default install options.</p>
<p>Once complete, we can check that things have been installed correctly by opening either <code>cmd</code> or <code>powershell</code> or your
terminal of choice, and run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">cargo version
</code></pre>
<h3 id="gcc-optional-but-recommended"><a class="header" href="#gcc-optional-but-recommended">GCC (optional, but recommended)</a></h3>
<p>Wait, the rustup website doesn’t mention this!</p>
<p>I know, and you don’t <em>necessarily</em> need to do this. However, Rust is a language that can interop with other languages.
In particular, Rust works really well with existing C and C++ libraries, however, Windows and Linux us different C++
libraries. This can be fixed by installing <code>gcc</code>.</p>
<p>Like Microsoft’s build tools, gcc isn’t packaged by itself, but unlike Microsoft’s build tools there are many, many ways
to install it.</p>
<p>The easiest way I’ve found is to install the <a href="https://scoop.sh" title="" target="_blank">Scoop</a> package manager by following the instructions on
their website.</p>
<p>Once installed, all you need to do is run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">scoop install main/gcc
</code></pre>
<p>You can check this worked by running <code>gcc --version</code></p>
<p>Phew! That’s it, congratulations! It took me over an hour to do this on my first attempt.</p>
<p>If you haven’t done already, its a good idea to restart your computer before moving on.</p>

<h2 id="visual-studio-code"><a class="header" href="#visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</a></h2>
<p>A software developers environment is something very specific to them. Some people love vim and neovim, others like Nova,
I’m personally a big fan of IntelliJ. If you’ve already found the tools for you, there’s no wrong answer here, use
whatever makes you happy.</p>
<p>If you’re new to software engineering though, and not looking to fork out potentially hundreds of dollars on tooling,
I recommend Visual Studio Code. It’s free, is perhaps the most widely used and supported editor today, and can be
greatly extended through plugins.</p>
<p>It’s the editor I’ll be using throughout this series as I believe it will be the most familiar to people.</p>
<p>To get started head over to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" title="" target="_blank">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a> and download the right
version for your device.</p>
<p>After installing it, we will need some plugins to work with Rust. To get to extensions, open VSCode and press the
extensions button in the sidebar (by default the sidebar is on the left).</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/images/vscode-extensions.png" alt="VSCode Extensions" /></p>
<h2 id="extensions"><a class="header" href="#extensions">Extensions</a></h2>
<h3 id="rust-analyzer"><a class="header" href="#rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a></h3>
<p>Rust Analyzer will provide the bulk of language support that we’ll need. It’ll give us auto complete, syntax
highlighting and symbol editing that will just make our lives a lot easier. Search for <code>rust-analyzer</code> in the search
bar at the top of the extensions tab and click install.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/images/vscode-extension-rust-analyzer.png" alt="vscode-extension-rust-analyzer.png" /></p>
<h3 id="codelldb"><a class="header" href="#codelldb">CodeLLDB</a></h3>
<p>As we learn any new language, one of the most important things for us to be able to do is see what’s actually happening.
CodeLLDB allows us to pause a program while its running and see what its doing. This lets us check that a program is
doing what we think its doing.</p>

<h3 id="even-better-toml"><a class="header" href="#even-better-toml">Even Better TOML</a></h3>
<p>The Rust ecosystem makes heavy use of the TOML file format. We’ll talk about this more much later on but now is a good
time to pick up this extension.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/images/vscode-extension-toml.png" alt="vscode-extension-toml.png" /></p>
<h3 id="crates"><a class="header" href="#crates">crates</a></h3>
<p>Rust developers share code through a mechanism called Crates. This extension will help us keep any crates we depend on
up to date. We won’t be using crates for a while, but it’s good to grab now. </p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hello-world"><a class="header" href="#hello-world">Hello World</a></h1>
<p>Now that we’re finally set up, lets create our first program. As is tradition, our first program is simply going to
print the words <code>Hello, world!</code>.</p>

<p>Open Visual Studio Code and open the terminal.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you’re new to Visual Studio Code and you want the editor to do something (say, for example, open a
terminal), hold <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Shift</code> and press <code>P</code> (or <code>Cmd</code> + <code>Shift</code> and press <code>P</code> on Mac). You can then type the thing
you want to do, and it should show up in the list. Sometimes, like with Terminal, you might get a lot of results and
the one you want might need a little scroll. Normally for a Terminal you want to use it internally, so you’d scroll to
<code>Terminal: Create New Terminal</code></p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/vscode-any-command-terminal.png" alt="Open the terminal" /></p>
<p>Navigate to an appropriate location for your projects such as your home directory or my documents, depending on your
system.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this on Mac and Linux is to do <code>cd ~</code></p>
<p>There isn’t really an equivalent on Windows, so if you aren’t sure you can instead use Explorer to open My Documents,
right-click an empty space in the window, click “More Options” then “Open in Terminal”</p>
<p>Run <code>cargo new hello-world</code>, and cargo will report that it has created the project</p>
<p>Cargo is the program we’ll use to run our rust programs as well as many of the rust tools that will help us along the
way.</p>
<p>Now in Visual Studio Code, go to File -&gt; Open Folder and navigate to the hello-world folder we just created.</p>
<p>You can see that cargo has created some files for us. We’re going to talk about the cargo files later but for now,
head into the <code>src</code> directory and open main.rs</p>
<p>You can see the file has already been created with the following code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Before we dive into this further, lets run the program.</p>
<p>Open the terminal again, as we did before. This time use <code>cargo run</code> to run our program, you should see something like
the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cargo run
   Compiling hello-world v0.1.0 (D:\Documents\hello-world)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33s
     Running `target\debug\hello-world.exe`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Well, that was easy 😅</p>
<p>You’ll find the Rust community has put a lot of effort into making Rust as easy as possible to learn and use.</p>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-hello-world"><a class="header" href="#anatomy-of-hello-world">Anatomy of Hello World</a></h2>
<p>Let’s talk about hello world.</p>
<p>The first line <code>fn main()</code> describes a function (fn) called main. Functions are a useful way to group up a bit of code
to be called elsewhere. We’ll talk more about the power of functions and when to use them in a future chapter. For now
all we need to know is that the main function is called when the program starts, so any code we put in here will run.</p>
<p>At the moment, the only line of code is <code>println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);</code>. A lot of engineers might assume this is how we
call functions in Rust, and that <code>println</code> is the function name. However, the exclamation mark actually tells us this
is a macro. Macros are very powerful and can do much more than functions, however they are an advanced topic, and we
won’t be creating our own until much later. We will be using pre-written macros a fair bit though.</p>
<p><code>println!</code> will write what it’s given to the console.</p>
<h2 id="running-and-debugging-rust"><a class="header" href="#running-and-debugging-rust">Running and Debugging Rust</a></h2>
<p>Before we end this section, I want to quickly set up one of the most powerful tools we have thats going to help us
learn incredibly quickly.</p>
<p>First let’s make a quick change to our program, by adding a variable with our name, and then saying hello to ourselves
instead of the whole world</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let name = &quot;Daniel&quot;;
    println!(&quot;Hello, {name}!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Fun fact, Rust uses utf-8 strings when written like this, so don’t worry if your name can not be properly represented in
American English characters. For example, I might naively write my cats name like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let name = &quot;ユキ&quot;;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>However, this won’t actually output correctly unless your system is set up to display it (thanks Windows).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hover the mouse over the <code>3</code> denoting line 3 (where the <code>println!</code> should be) you should see a little red dot  appear.
Click this dot to set a break point. When debugging code, the debugger will pause at break points allowing us to see
what’s actually happening.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/vscode-breakpoint.png" alt="Breakpoints" /></p>
<p>To debug our code press F5… and it will immediately show you an error. Don’t panic! This is where CodeLLDB is going
to do some magic for us. The error is because we didn’t set a default run configuration, click OK and Visual Studio Code
will ask if you want to generate one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Depending on your personal configuration, it may ask you want to create the configuration from. If you
are asked this, click <code>LLDB</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click “yes”, then press F5 again, and the program will start and then pause when it hits line 3.</p>
<p>If you mouse over <code>name</code> on either line 2 or line 3, you’ll see its value. Being able to see what’s happening in a
running program is a programming superpower.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/vscode-debug.png" alt="Breakpoints" /></p>
<p>To let the program continue, hit F5 one more time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="language-basics"><a class="header" href="#language-basics">Language Basics</a></h1>
<p>In this section we’re going to step through the language basics, attempting to cover enough to quickly move on to
language idioms. By doing this, we hope that people won’t end up with a lot of bad habits (like some of us did) as the
“easy” bits that help you get started end up overly ingrained in your memory.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="memory"><a class="header" href="#memory">Memory</a></h1>
<p>When you create a program, how does it remember things? In the last chapter, we created a variable and put our name
inside it. Where was our name stored?</p>
<p>Jumping into memory already might seem unusual. A lot of programming tutorials in any language would like to get you
writing code before you have to worry about such things. However, I think right off the bat we have a wonderful
opportunity to talk about how memory works in Rust and, because memory is so important to how Rust works, I think this
will simplify everything you learn going forward.</p>
<p>We’re going to make an extremely simple program and use that as the basis to explain how Rust remembers.</p>
<h2 id="the-guessing-game"><a class="header" href="#the-guessing-game">The Guessing Game</a></h2>
<p>To learn about memory, we’ll make a simplified version of the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html" title="" target="_blank">guessing game</a> 
from the official Rust book. Start by opening your terminal and navigating to where-ever your creating you projects like
in the last chapter, then we’ll create a new project with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">cargo new guessing-game
</code></pre>
<p>Open the project in you editor and open the file <code>src/main.rs</code>. As before we’ll see the same “hello, world” program:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>As we step through this tutorial, if you mouse over the code examples, you can see some buttons that will let you</p>
<ol>
<li>⎘ Copy the example to your clipboard</li>
<li>⏵ Run the example via <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org" title="" target="_blank">rust playground</a> (where possible)</li>
<li>👁 Show any code I’ve opted to hide for clarity, try this on the next block</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s quickly change our hello world message to something that welcomes us to the game.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    println!(&quot;Welcome to the guessing game!&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>And ask the user to do something:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Welcome to the guessing game!&quot;);
</span>    println!(&quot;I have chosen a color red, green or blue, can you guess which?&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Because we’ve used a second <code>println!</code> this will appear on a new line. The new line actually comes at the end of the
<code>println!</code> so if you want to make both sentences appear on the same line, you can change the first one with <code>print!</code> 
(no “ln”). Try it out and see what else you might need to change!</p>
<p>Let’s pick a color that the user has to guess. To begin with we’ll just hard code one value, later we’ll make it choose
randomly. I’m going to choose blue, but you can choose whatever you like:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let actual = &quot;blue&quot;;
<span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Welcome to the guessing game!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;I have chosen a color red, green or blue, can you guess which?&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Before we move on, I want to call out the “type” of the data we’ve just created.</p>
<p>We’re going to talk about types in the next chapter, but I want to quickly point some things out. The type of data
describes a number of things but mainly, how that data is represented in memory and how it can be used. For example, is
the data a string (like “blue”), or a number, or a boolean that represent true or false.</p>
<p>If you’re using an editor that shows type information you might see that next to <code>actual</code> its written something like 
<code>: &amp;str</code>, eg:</p>
<p><img src="language-basics/memory/type-annotation.png" alt="type-annotation.png" /></p>
<p>This means that the variable <code>actual</code> contains a “reference” (represented by the <code>&amp;</code>) to a “string slice” (represented
by <code>str</code>). We’ll talk about why the variable only contains a reference and not the data itself later. You could, if you
like, manually write this <code>let actual: &amp;str = &quot;blue&quot;</code> yourself, however, it’s generally better to let Rust infer the
type, and only write it yourself if either Rust is unable to decide (because it could be multiple things) or if you want
to use something different. </p>
<p>This is why it’s a good idea to make sure whatever you’re writing Rust in shows you what
Rust has decided a type is. For example, the default integer type in Rust is <code>i32</code> (don’t worry, we’ll explain this
later), however your program might have specific requirements that make it sensible to annotate the type so that Rust
uses a <code>u64</code> instead. (Yes, Rust has many different types for representing numbers, we’ll worry about that next time 😊)</p>
<p><img src="language-basics/memory/inferred-vs-annotated.png" alt="inferred-vs-annotated.png" /></p>
<p>Anyway, back to the program: let’s output the color. This will end up being the last thing in the program, but we can
use this to check everything is working ok:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let actual = &quot;blue&quot;;
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Welcome to the guessing game!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;I have chosen a color red, green or blue?&quot;);
</span>    println!(&quot;The color I chose was {actual}&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We can run this now and see that the color to be guessed was entered.</p>
<p>Great… but not much of a game is it.</p>
<p>In order to get some user input, we need to read from the terminal. Before we tell the user what the actual color was
lets ask them to guess</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let actual = &quot;blue&quot;;
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Welcome to the guessing game!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;I have chosen a color red, green or blue&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">   
</span>    println!(&quot;Enter your guess: red, green or blue&quot;);
<span class="boring">   
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;The color I chose was {actual}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>We’re then going to read a line of input from the user. When the program runs in the terminal, we can ask the user to
type things, regardless of whether you are on Windows, Mac or Linux, this input is passed into the program through a
stream of data called <code>stdin</code> (standard in).</p>
<p>Rust comes with a “standard library” (the name is unrelated to the stream) that we can access as a module called <code>std</code>.
I pronounce this S T D, but you may also here people call it “stud”. Modules in Rust are a way of grouping up other bits
of code such as functions, data types and even other modules. We’ll talk about them more in a future lesson. Inside of
this is another module called <code>io</code> that deals with input and output. If we weren’t using the <code>println!</code> macro, this is
where we’d have to come to write things out to the terminal too, via a stream called <code>stdout</code> (standard out).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For completion’s sake I should mention there is one more stream called <code>stderr</code> (standard error). This is also an
output stream that we can use to separate “good” output that is relevant to the normal use of the program to really 
any other kind of output, whether that be errors or just information not directly relevant to the main output.</p>
<p>For example, on Mac and Linux, if you use <code>cargo run 2&gt; /dev/null</code> to run your program, you’ll see that you lose the
messages about your program being compiled because we redirected stderr (stream 2) to the void of <code>/dev/null</code>, and
Cargo sensibly decided that <em>it’s</em> output is not relevant to your programs normal output</p>
<p>On Windows the same can be achieved in cmd using <code>cargo run 2&gt; nul</code> (note, only one l in nul), or in powershell with
<code>cargo run 2&gt; $null</code> (two l’s this time and a dollar, no idea why it’s different)</p>
<p><code>stderr</code> is really useful for things like logging, and we’ll talk more about streams in the future, but if you want
to quickly write something to this stream you can use <code>eprintln!</code> and <code>eprint!</code> the same way we use <code>println!</code> and
<code>print!</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we get stdin using <code>std::io::stdin()</code>, this is a function call (we’ll talk about functions in a couple of chapters), 
that returns something called a “handle” that we can use for temporary access to the input stream.</p>
<p>The double colons just tell Rust that you’re looking for something inside a module. We’ll cover modules in detail later,
including how, why and when to make your own, as well as better ways to access them, but since we only need to write
this line once, this is the easiest way to do it.</p>
<p>We could store the result of <code>stdin()</code> in a variable, however, we only use this once, and then we’re done with it, so,
off the back of the function call, we can call immediately call <code>.lines()</code>. This is a method (a special type of function
that belongs specifically to some other thing, in this case it belongs to the handle for stdin). In the example below
I’ve put this on a new line for legibility, but you don’t <em>need</em> to do this.</p>
<p><code>.lines()</code> returns an iterator, allowing us to iterate (step through) each line one at a time. We get the next line by
calling <code>.next()</code> on the iterator.</p>
<p>If we add this all in our code looks like this</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">   let actual = &quot;blue&quot;;
</span><span class="boring">   
</span><span class="boring">   println!(&quot;Welcome to the guessing game!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">   println!(&quot;I have chosen a color red, green or blue&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">   
</span><span class="boring">   println!(&quot;Enter your guess: red, green or blue&quot;);
</span>    let input = std::io::stdin()
        .lines()
        .next()
        .expect(&quot;No input was read&quot;)
        .expect(&quot;There was an error when reading the input&quot;);
            
    println!(&quot;Your guess was {input}&quot;);
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">   println!(&quot;The color I chose was {actual}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>Wait wait wait, what are those <code>expect</code>s about?!</p>
<p><code>expect()</code> is, I would say, the second-worst way you could handle something going wrong in your program. This is not
“idiomatic” and you absolutely should not use this in anything except the most throw away software as it will 
immediately cause the program to stop and spew a lot of information at the user. In the future we’ll talk about things
going wrong and how to better handle them, however, as this program is just for you, I think you’ll cope for now. 😊</p>
<p>That doesn’t explain what these lines are doing, or why there are two of them though. The reason for this is that there
are two possible ways <code>.lines()</code> might not work.</p>
<p>The first expect then:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">.expect(&quot;No input was read&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>When we call <code>.next()</code> on any iterator, there either is something next or there isn’t.  In some languages this
might return either the data you expect, or a <code>null</code> value. For example, it might return <code>&quot;red&quot;</code> or <code>null</code>. “red” is a
string but null is not, what happens if you pass this to a function that expects a string? This means you must either
manually check the thing returned was null, or don’t check, and risk your program breaking at some other point.
Obviously many people think this ambiguity is bad, including Tony Hoare, arguably the “inventor” of this  behavior, who
has called it his “billion-dollar mistake”.</p>
<p>Rust does not allow you to use types like this interchangeably, i.e. data can not be a string or null as these types are
not compatible. In Rust, we use a kind of container type to get around this called <code>Option</code>. Importantly, when a 
function returns an <code>Option</code> type you, the programmer, must check to see if it contains something, and then extract the
thing if it’s there. There are a number of ways to do this and <code>.expect</code> is one of the worst ways to do this (we’ll talk
about better ways in the future), as it will attempt to extract the data if its there, or stop the program abruptly with
the provided error message if it’s not.</p>
<p>For the time being we’re going to just say we can’t deal with it not being there, we don’t want to continue running the
program, and we want the program to stop. We use <code>.expect(&quot;message&quot;)</code> to say, if this is nothing, we are giving up,
stop the program and print our message (plus a few other useful bits) to the <code>stderr</code> (see above). You can see why this
behaviour is typically undesirable but that we can allow it for this example, at least until we learn how to deal with
<code>Option</code> properly.</p>
<p>The second expect is a bit different:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">.expect(&quot;There was an error when reading the input&quot;);</code></pre>
<p>If the Option we got from <code>.next()</code> contains something instead of nothing, it <em>still</em> doesn’t necessarily mean we read
the users input correctly, reading data from <code>stdin</code> is itself fallible.</p>
<p>Fallibility, the nature that something may go wrong, in programming is another thing we’ve traditionally handled very
badly. A common way to deal with this in other languages is to stop executing and “throw” an error. The problem with
throwing errors is that it breaks the flow of execution, the next thing to get executed is not obvious, it’s going to
be wherever the error is “caught”… if it’s “caught”. Sometimes you may not even realise that some code you’ve written
could throw an error because you’ve called someone else’s code, and they didn’t make it obvious that their code could
fail.</p>
<p>Rust does away with this with another type called <code>Result</code>. If your function can fail, it must return a Result type.
Like with <code>Option</code>, <code>Result</code> is its own type that contains either the data we wanted, or an error.</p>
<p>Again, the idiomatic way to handle this depends on what you’re trying to do; is the error recoverable (could the program
continue despite the error), and how do we want to report the error back to the user. Using <code>expect</code> will, again, cause
the program to immediately stop with the error message and other bits sent to <code>stderr</code>, and again, you can see why this
is typically extremely undesirable.</p>
<p>But anyway, we now have a working program, there is an actual color, the user guesses a color, and we print both to the
screen.</p>
<h2 id="memory-1"><a class="header" href="#memory-1">Memory</a></h2>
<p>You might have spotted that <code>actual</code> and <code>input</code> have different types (don’t worry if you didn’t, when you added all the
code associated with getting the input, it added a lot of types, so you could easily miss it). </p>
<p>Importantly though, <code>actual</code> is a <code>&amp;str</code>, which is a reference to a string slice. However, <code>input</code> is a <code>String</code>.</p>
<p>What’s the difference?</p>
<h3 id="the-stack"><a class="header" href="#the-stack">The Stack</a></h3>
<p>To understand this, we have to talk a little bit about how our program runs.</p>
<p>In Rust (and many languages in fact), programs are made up of functions; small, independent bits of code. In our
program we only have one function for now, which is <code>main</code>, but this still applies. When we run our program, the
operating system assigns some memory for the program to run in, called “the stack”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: Some people like to think about the stack going from top to bottom because the memory address go down like
lines on a page (or lines of code), but most people talk about it going from bottom to top because we talk about
putting things on the stack which is easier to visualise. It’s an abstraction, so it doesn’t really matter. I’m going
to explain it from bottom to top as I think this makes visualising the manipulation of the stack easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each time we run a function we create a new block of memory on the stack that’s the exact size of everything that
function needs to remember. So, for example, if our function has three numbers in it, then our new block on the stack
will be exactly the size of required to store those three numbers.</p>
<p><img src="language-basics/memory/stack.gif" alt="How the Stack works" /></p>
<p>In the example above we’re representing the memory of the stack. When the program is initialized the operating system
assigns some memory for the stack, then, all the memory required to store all the variables in <code>main</code> (which it in this
example is 4 addresses) is blocked off. Then, as <code>main</code> runs, it calls another function, <code>f1</code> which requires two
more addresses. <code>f1</code> then calls another function which requires 3 addresses worth of memory, <code>f2</code>. Once <code>f2</code> has
finished, it is removed from the stack, then <code>f1</code> finishes, and it too is removed from the stack. Finally <code>main</code> comes
to an end and our program closes and all memory is freed.</p>
<p>You can see that the amount of memory a function needs is very important, but… how long is a <del>piece of</del> string?</p>
<p>Our three colors, “red”, “blue” and “green” are 3 characters, 4 characters and 5 characters respectively. How much
memory should we assign on the stack? What about the users input? Is that 3 characters, 4 characters or the complete
works of Shakespeare? How much memory each function will require is decided at build time, and we don’t know what the
user is going to write until later.</p>
<p>Anything that lives inside a variable goes on the stack, and anything on the stack must be of known size when the
program is compiled. In Rust, we have a specific name for this “Sized”. Things like numbers, characters, booleans
and even tuples are Sized, but a string of characters is not, it is “Unsized”.</p>
<p>So where does our data live if not inside the variables?</p>
<p>Returning to the top, you’ll remember that our <code>actual</code> variable has the type <code>&amp;str</code> which is a reference (<code>&amp;</code>) to a
string slice <code>str</code>. A reference is something that points to where some actual data is, this is very handy when you want
to tell something about some data without having to give it the specific data. When you manually write a string between
double quotes <code>&quot;like this&quot;</code>, it’s called a “string literal”. This applies to our variable as well as every time we’ve
used in a <code>println!</code>. A “string slice” can be any part of a string stored somewhere else, so it can be characters 0 to 3
(b, l, u, e) of our string literal that’s stored in the executable.</p>
<h3 id="the-heap"><a class="header" href="#the-heap">The Heap</a></h3>
<p>Our <code>input</code>, however, is very different, we don’t know what’s going to be in here at all at compile time. In order to
store the data that the user gives us, we still need to put it in memory somewhere, but it can’t live on the stack.</p>
<p>Instead, we use another kind of memory called “the Heap”. At any point while the program is running, we can ask the
operating system to allow us to access some amount of memory. We still need to know how much memory we need, but now we
only need to know how much memory at runtime. This memory comes from the Heap. In the heap, we can store “Unsized” data
(as well as Sized which can be useful under certain circumstances) and, then because everything about the location of
that data is Sized, we can store it in a variable on the stack. <code>String</code> does not contain the data, but does know where
the data is.</p>
<p>Some other important differences between the Stack and the Heap. The Stack is more limited in size, you should try to
avoid storing large amounts of data here (even if the size is known). Creating memory on the Heap takes longer than
creating it on the Stack, this is because you have to communicate your requirements to the operating system and
wait for it to get back to you with that allocation. This doesn’t take too long, but one thing to watch out for is
repeatedly increasing the amount you need. If you create a string of a certain size, then ask for more memory (eg, by
appending more data to it), then in the background Rust will ask the operating system for a new, larger block of memory,
then it has to copy the old data to it, before adding anything else on to the end.</p>
<p>This is all great, but why is one of them <code>&amp;str</code> and one of them <code>String</code> if both of them are just references to data
stored elsewhere? This actually comes down to “ownership”. We’ll go into ownership in more detail later in a later
chapter but at a very high level a reference to a string slice does not own the string data. Ownership allows full
control over the data, and most importantly, it tells the program when to clean up the data. When an <code>&amp;str</code> is no longer
needed, the reference is cleaned up, but the data still exists. When a <code>String</code> is no longer needed, not only is the
reference cleaned up, but memory is returned to the operating systems control, freeing it up for something else to use.</p>
<p>It’s important to note though that <code>&amp;str</code> and <code>String</code> are different types. The data they reference is formatted the
same way in memory, but they are not interchangeable. Later, when we discuss functions, you’ll see that if a function
requires a <code>String</code> you can not pass it a <code>&amp;str</code> and vice versa. You can, however, trivially go from one to another.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let name = &quot;Daniel&quot;;                   // This is a &amp;str pointing at a sequence of bytes in the executable
let name_on_heap = String::from(name); // This requests memory from the operating system then copies &quot;Daniel&quot; into it
let name_ref = name_on_heap.as_str();  // This is a &amp;str pointing to a sequence of bytes on the heap
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>That said, they can be compared to each other (this actually goes for any data type in Rust so long as someone has told
Rust how to do the comparison, which for <code>&amp;str</code> and <code>String</code>, someone has).</p>
<p>Let’s return to our program one last time. Below I’ve written out the full program and added an <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statement.</p>
<p><code>if</code>/<code>else</code> is a form of control flow. We put an expression inside the “if” that evaluates to either true or false, in 
this  case we’re asking if <code>input</code> is equal to <code>actual</code>. If it is, then the execution continues inside the if block
(the bit between the curly brackets), if it’s not true, then instead execution continues inside the else block.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">fn main() {
    let actual = &quot;blue&quot;;
    
    println!(&quot;Welcome to the guessing game!&quot;);

    println!(&quot;Enter your guess: red, green or blue&quot;);
    let input = std::io::stdin()

<h2 id="to-review"><a class="header" href="#to-review">To Review:</a></h2>
<p>Today we learned specifically about the Stack and Heap:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Stack is where variables live, data must be of known size at compile time (Sized), but access is very fast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Heap is where we can store things regardless of whether we know their size at compile time (Sized and Unsized).
We can store large amounts of data here but getting access to this memory initially is a tiny be slower.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can reference data with <code>&amp;</code> if you don’t want ownership of the data, but you do want to access it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also learned a bit about <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> which we will go into more in the next chapter, and future chapters
too.</p>
<p>Finally, we learned that we can control the flow of execution with <code>if</code>, however, this isn’t the only way we can effect
the flow, and we’ll talk more about this in a couple of chapters.</p>
<p>Next time we’re going to look more at data types; what the basic types are, how we create new types, and how we can
merge types together.</p>
<h2 id="bonus"><a class="header" href="#bonus">Bonus</a></h2>
<p>You don’t need to do this but if you want to make your <code>actual</code> value random(ish) and turn this into a proper game,
then you could do it like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {

<p>First we create an array of string slices for each possible value. Arrays are of known size at build time, for example,
this one contains three string slice references, therefore its size is 3x whatever the size of a reference is. This
means it’s Sized, therefore does exist on the stack. We’ll talk more about dynamic (therefore Unsized) collections in
the next chapter.</p>
<p>To fake randomness we’re going to take the time at the Unix Epoch (the 1st of January 1970) and find the <code>Duration</code> of
time that has elapsed since then. Asking how much time has passed <em>since</em> another point in time is fallible because you
might be asking about a time in the future, this means we have to deal with a <code>Result</code>. This <em>shouldn’t</em> ever actually
return an error, but even when you’re absolutely sure, there’s no harm leaving a little message in the <code>.expect()</code> for
anyone else who happens to be looking at the code.</p>
<p><code>.as_millis</code> turns the duration into a 128bit integer (<code>u128</code>), but collections (like our array) are index with a
<code>usize</code>. The exact length in bits of a <code>usize</code> depends on the target system you’re building for (usually 64bits but not
always). Because 128bits is longer than 64bits we need to shrink it down. <code>as usize</code> will truncate the most significant
bits. This <em>can</em> mean your number changes, but we don’t actually care for our purposes, we just want a nice big number
that is different each time we run the program. I left myself a comment (using <code>//</code> you can write things that aren’t
code), so that if I wonder why I did this in the future, I’ll know.</p>
<p>Finally, we pick a random color from our colors array by dividing the time in milliseconds since the 1st of January 1970
by the length of the array (3) and getting the remainder. You can do all of this with the remainder <code>%</code> operator. This
gives us a number between 0 and 2 inclusive, so we use that number as the index in our array using the square brackets.</p>
<p>This leaves us with one of the string slice references from the array, which one will depend on the exact time when you
run the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ <strong>Important:</strong> In some languages <code>%</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo" title="" target="_blank">modulo operator</a>, in Rust it is the
remainder operator.</p>

<p>We’ll go over each of these individually, explain how they work, their variations and what you might use them for.</p>
<p>Before we do, lets very quickly cover binary.</p>
<h3 id="binary-primer"><a class="header" href="#binary-primer">Binary Primer</a></h3>
<p>Don’t panic! No one is expecting you to learn to count in binary. Counting in binary is fun, but pretty useless. 😅</p>
<p>All I want to do is show you how things are represented in memory because it’s going to make all those Rust types make a
lot of sense!</p>
<p>Humans (mostly) count in base 10. That’s numbers going from 0 to 9. You can imagine numbers as a series of columns,
where each column represents how many 1s, 10s, 100s, etc there are in the number.</p>
<p>For example, the number 123 contains one lot of 100, two lots of 10, and three lots of 1</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Columns:</th><th>100</th><th>10</th><th>1</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Count:</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>When we add numbers to the columns, if the column goes over 9, then we add to the next column along.</p>
<p>So, if we add 1 to 9, it goes to 10, 19 goes to 20, and 99 goes to 100 (because the roll-over from the right most 9 adds
to the next 9 also causing it to roll over).</p>
<p>This counting system is called base 10 by the way as each of those columns is 10 raised to the power of which column it
is, starting at 0:</p>
<ul>
<li>10^0 = 1</li>
<li>10^1 = 10</li>
<li>10^2 = 100</li>
<li>10^3 = 1000</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Electronics, and by extension computers, can only really cope reliably with things that are <code>on</code> or <code>off</code> though. How do
you count with only on or off? Well, what if instead of having ten possible values in each column (0-9 or base 10), we
only have two (0-1 or base 2). This is binary.</p>
<p>In binary our columns are a bit different:</p>
<ul>
<li>2^0 = 1</li>
<li>2^1 = 2</li>
<li>2^2 = 4</li>
<li>2^3 = 8</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>So if we want to represent the number 11 in base 2, we can see it contains one 8, one 2, and one 1.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Columns:</th><th>8</th><th>4</th><th>2</th><th>1</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Count:</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Sometimes when we want to write something in binary and be explicit that that is the system we’re using we might write:
<code>0b1011</code>. This makes it clear that this number represents “eleven” and not “one thousand and eleven”.</p>
<p>Each column is a <em><strong>b</strong></em>inary dig<em><strong>it</strong></em>, which is where we get the term “bit”.</p>
<p>Eight bits is a byte, and can represent the numbers from <code>0b0000_0000</code> (zero) to <code>0b1111_1111</code> (two hundred and 
fifty-five, again, I’m not expecting anyone to be able to <em>read</em> this). Also note that I’m using an underscore as a 
spacer between numbers to help legibility, this also works in Rust, as does the <code>0b</code> notation!</p>
<p>The reason why a byte is eight bits has a lot of history, but it basically comes down to character encoding: with 7
bits, you can represent 127 characters which covers english lowercase, uppercase, numbers 0-9, various whitespace and
punctuation, and still have 1 bit left over for simple error checking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a total aside, as a software engineer, you’re very likely to also see number written in hexadecimal (base 16).
This is because hexadecimal, is really nice when working with bytes. One byte (8 bits) perfectly maps to two
hexadecimal digits. Hexadecimal digits go from 0 to 15, but are represented as 0-F (ie: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
A, B, C, D, E, F).</p>
<p><code>0xF</code> is 15, and so is <code>0b1111</code>. The number 255 is much easier to write as <code>0xFF</code> than <code>0b1111_1111</code>. This <code>0x</code> 
notation also works in Rust.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="integers"><a class="header" href="#integers">Integers</a></h3>
<p>Now that you’ve had that primer on binary, I bet those 12 different integer types are starting to make a lot more sense!</p>
<p>The most basic number type in Rust is the <code>u8</code>. This is an <em>unsigned</em> integer (represented by the <code>u</code>) that is 8 bits in
length. Unsigned means that the number can only be positive (it does not have a negative sign). You might have already
guessed, but this is one byte, and can hold the numbers 0 to 255. A byte like this can be used for all sorts of things,
though one common example is as part of a color. We often represent colors as 8 bits of red, 8 bits of green,
8 bits of blue and sometimes 8 bits of transparency.</p>
<p><code>i8</code> is an integer that can represent both positive and negative numbers (i.e. it’s signed). It also only uses 8 bits
of data but in order to represent a number, however, instead of going from 0 to 255, it goes from -128 to 127.</p>
<p>You never need to know this, <em>but</em>, if you’re interested in the mathematics of how it does this, it uses a method called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement" title="" target="_blank">two’s complement</a>.</p>
<p>This, however, is complicated, and we don’t think like computers. The easiest way to think about it is the left most
column is the negative version of itself, and all other numbers are the same. So, the number -125 can be represented as
<code>0b1000_0011</code>.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Columns:</th><th>-128</th><th>64</th><th>32</th><th>16</th><th>8</th><th>4</th><th>2</th><th>1</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Count:</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>ie, the number contains one -128, one 2 and one 1, adding (-128 + 2 + 1) them is -125.</p>
<p>So that’s <code>u8</code> and <code>i8</code>, and now you’ve probably guessed that for all the other integer types;</p>
<ul>
<li><code>u</code> means it can only be positive</li>
<li><code>i</code> means it can be positive or negative</li>
<li>the number after is how many bits are available to the number</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we can build up a little table to show the minimum and maximum of these types:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>type</th><th style="text-align: right">min</th><th style="text-align: right">max</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>u8</td><td style="text-align: right">0</td><td style="text-align: right">255</td></tr>

<p>Wow, those numbers get big fast!</p>
<p>There’s still two types missing though; <code>usize</code> and <code>isize</code>.</p>
<p>In this case, the <code>size</code> is also acting as the number of bits, however, unlike the other integer types, the size of
<code>size</code> is variable.</p>
<p>Rust is a compiled language, meaning that the code you write in Rust is transformed into instructions that a CPU can
understand. CPUs are all different, but they typically follow some given “architecture”. For example, if you’re
reading this on a Windows or Linux desktop or an Intel Mac, the architecture of your CPU is <em>probably</em> <code>x86_64</code>. If
you’re reading this on an “Apple Silicon” Mac or a mobile phone, then the architecture is <em>probably</em> <code>arm64</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A quick aside, the world of CPU architecture is a bit of a mess so <code>x86_64</code> may also be referred to as <code>amd64</code> as AMD
were the designers of the architecture, but it was designed to be backwards compatible with Intel’s <code>x86</code>
architecture. Similarly <code>arm64</code> is also sometimes referred to as <code>AArch64</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you compile Rust it will compile into an instruction set for the architecture your machine uses, though you can
also tell it what instruction set to compile for if you want to build it on one architecture but run it on another.</p>
<p><code>x86_64</code> and <code>arm64</code> are both 64bit architectures, so when you build for these machines, the <code>size</code> in <code>usize</code> and
<code>isize</code> becomes <code>64</code>. However, if you were to compile for, say, a Cortex-M0 chip, then the instruction set would likely
be <code>Thumb-1</code> which is 16bit so the <code>size</code> in <code>usize</code> and <code>isize</code> becomes <code>16</code>.</p>
<h4 id="which-integer-is-right-for-you"><a class="header" href="#which-integer-is-right-for-you">Which integer is right for you?</a></h4>
<p>You might think the obvious thing to do would be to use the largest possible number, for example, you can fit pretty
much every whole number you could possibly need into <code>i128</code>, so why use anything else?</p>
<p>There’s two things to think about, first, what is the intended use of the number and, second, what is the architecture
of the machine you’re running on?</p>
<p>In software engineering, a number is never just a number, it represents something. As we mentioned earlier,
colors are often (but not always), represented as 0 to 255 for each of red, green and blue. This means that a <code>u8</code> is
the best way to store these. If you combine those three colors with another 8 bits for transparency (alpha), then you
have four lots of <code>u8</code> which can be represented as a <code>u32</code>.</p>
<p><code>u8</code> is also a good size for representing a stream of unicode characters, which is where we get <code>UTF-8</code>, the default
encoding for Rust strings.</p>
<p>For larger numbers though, you still may not want to use the largest. While you can use integers that are wider than the
architecture that you’re running your program on, like using a <code>u128</code> ion a 64 bit machine, mathematics with those 
numbers will be slower. The CPU can only process so many bits at once, so when it has numbers larger than that, it has
to do multiple rounds of processing to achieve the same results as it might have done if those numbers were stored in
smaller integers.</p>
<p>You might then think that the best thing to do is use a <code>usize</code> or <code>isize</code> if you don’t really care about how big a
number can get, and that’s fine, and I often do this, but now you have to bear in mind that the behaviour of your 
program may no longer be consistent on different machines!</p>
<p>By default, when you write an integer and store it in a variable, Rust will play it safe and use an <code>i32</code> as it doesn’t
know what you might want to do with the number, an <code>i32</code> will fit inside most CPU architectures without needing extra
work and allows negative numbers.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let a = 10; // i32
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>However, it is more idiomatic to be intentional about the types you use. My methodology here is roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>does this number represent something of a specific size like a color or ascii character, in which case, use that size</li>
<li>is this number going to be used to access an array, in which case it really ought to be a <code>usize</code></li>
<li>am I more worried about the number slowing the program down than I am about accidentally trying to store a big number
in a small integer, and do I not care about consistency, in which case <code>usize</code> or <code>isize</code></li>
<li>otherwise, if I’m ok potentially sacrificing speed, then an <code>i32</code> or <code>i64</code> is fine</li>
</ul>
<p>You can specify what type a number is either by annotating the variable you are putting it inside:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let a: u64 = 10; // u64
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Or, if that’s not possible because you are, for example, passing the number to a function that could take many number
types, you can write the type at the end of a number:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">use std::fmt::Display;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn print_value_and_type&lt;T: Display&gt;(v: T) {
</span><span class="boring">   let type_name = std::any::type_name::&lt;T&gt;();
</span><span class="boring">   println!(&quot;Type of '{v}' is {type_name}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>print_value_and_type(10u8); // u8
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<h4 id="a-brief-note-on-type-conversion"><a class="header" href="#a-brief-note-on-type-conversion">A brief note on Type Conversion</a></h4>
<p>Finally, you can convert between types in several ways, which we’ll talk about more later, but I wanted to quickly go
over some code from the last chapter.</p>
<p>In the bonus section of the last chapter, we got the number of milliseconds that had passed since midnight on the 1st
of January 1970, and then immediately used <code>as usize</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let time = std::time::UNIX_EPOCH
    .elapsed()
    .expect(&quot;Call the doctor, time went backwards&quot;)
    .as_millis() as usize; // We only need the least significant bits so this is safe
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The reason for this is the number of milliseconds since that date is approximately 1,710,000,000,000 and is
returned as a <code>u128</code>. We wanted to use this as part of a calculation to work out an index into an array. Indexes in
arrays are always <code>usize</code>. If you were to compile this program on a 32bit architecture, then the number of milliseconds
is greater than what would fit into a <code>usize</code> which would be a mere 4,294,967,295. When we use <code>as</code> it simply takes the
number, whatever it is and tries to cram it into the size <code>as &lt;type&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>When going from a larger size to a smaller size (in this case, from <code>u128</code> to the equivalent of <code>u32</code>) it simply cuts
off the front of the data, leaving the least significant bits. You can see this in the following program (don’t forget
you can run this in place with the play button):</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let time = std::time::UNIX_EPOCH
    .elapsed()
    .expect(&quot;Call the doctor, time went backwards&quot;)
    .as_millis();

let time_u32 = time as u32;

println!(&quot;Before conversion: {time}&quot;);
println!(&quot;After conversion: {time_u32}&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<h3 id="floating-points"><a class="header" href="#floating-points">Floating Points</a></h3>
<p>We’ve covered twelve different ways of storing whole numbers in Rust, but there are only two ways of storing numbers
with decimal points: <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code>.</p>
<p>Floating point numbers are things like <code>0.123</code> or <code>1.23</code> or even <code>123.0</code>. They’re called floating point because the
decimal point can move around (as opposed to fixed point, where there is always the same number of fractional digits).</p>
<p>You’re immediate thought here might be that you should use <code>f32</code> on 32bit systems, and <code>f64</code> on 64bit systems, but
actually this isn’t the way to think about these numbers.</p>
<p>You see, floating points are not perfectly accurate. The bits of a floating point number are broken into parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>a sign (+/-)</li>
<li>an exponent</li>
<li>a fraction</li>
</ul>
<p>Without going into too much detail on floating points this gives us a way of expressing very large numbers and very
small numbers but not every number in between (after all, there are infinite numbers between 0.0 and 1.0).</p>
<p>Imagine using a floating point number to represent money. Someone comes into a store to buy a $520.04 item, and they
have a coupon for $520.02. The remainder that they need to pay is 2 cents, right? Try running the next bit of code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>println!(&quot;520.04 - 520.02 should be 0.02&quot;);

// Single Precision Floating Point
let float_32 = 520.04_f32 - 520.02_f32;
println!(&quot;f32, {float_32}&quot;);

// Double Precision Floating Point
let float_64 = 520.04_f64 - 520.02_f64;
println!(&quot;f64, {float_64}&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Instead, if the currency you’re representing uses “hundredths” for its minor currency like USD or GBP, then you can
represent the total number that instead, eg of cents for dollars or pennies for pounds.</p>
<p>When should you use floats?</p>
<p>Floating point numbers are great for more abstract mathematics where perfect precisions isn’t strictly necessary, for
example, vectors, matrices and quaternions which are often used in applications like video games and scientific models.</p>
<p>As to which you should use, you might think that it comes down to architecture again, for example, a program targeting
a 32bit architecture should use an <code>f32</code> and a 64bit architecture should prefer an <code>f64</code>… but if that’s the case,
where is the <code>fsize</code>?</p>
<p>Actually, 32bit architectures are usually designed to support 64bit floating point numbers just fine, the difference
between <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code> is that regardless of architecture, <code>f32</code> is faster, and <code>f64</code> is more “fine grain”.</p>
<h3 id="characters"><a class="header" href="#characters">Characters</a></h3>
<p>In Rust, we have a special type the represents a single character called <code>char</code>. It is always 4 bytes (32bits) in size
and can be any valid “unicode scalar value” (which is to say, any character in unicode that’s not a control character).
In Rust a character is always written between single quotes, whereas string literals are always written between double
quotes.</p>
<p>You can use any valid unicode character whether that’s the upper or lowercase english letters A-Z, numbers 0-9, white
space characters, word characters from languages like Chinese and Japanese, emoji, or anything else that’s a “unicode
scalar value”.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let i = 'I';
let love = '💖';
let yuki = '雪';
println!(&quot;{i} {love} {yuki}&quot;); 
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We usually use characters in relation to finding things inside strings. You can also turn strings into a collection of
characters and vice versa, however its important to note that a character inside a string may not take up 4 bytes (for
example, english letters and numbers only take 1 byte), however, once turned into a character, it will take up four
bytes.</p>
<h3 id="boolean"><a class="header" href="#boolean">Boolean</a></h3>
<p>There is only one boolean type in Rust: <code>bool</code>. It represents <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Useless (but interesting!) information: In terms of how much space it uses, Rust considers it to be a single bit (an
i1) <em>however</em> LLVM, which is a tool Rust uses as an intermediate compilation step, will use a full byte, though the
value inside the byte will still be 0 for false and 1 for true.</p>
<p>Weirdly, if Rust got its way, the decimal value for a boolean as its stored in memory would be 0 for false and -1 for
true (remember in <code>i</code> numbers, the left most bit is its negative self). None of that matters, its just interesting 😅</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boolean values are usually reserved for <code>if</code> statements, and this is a good thing to look out for as finding it else
where <em>might</em> be a sign that the code isn’t written in the best way.</p>
<h3 id="string-slices"><a class="header" href="#string-slices">String slices</a></h3>
<p>Our old friend the string slice!</p>
<p>The type for a string slice is <code>str</code>, but you’ll never see anything with the <code>str</code> type, you will usually see this
as a reference to a string slice (<code>&amp;str</code>), which makes it unique amongst the primitive types. <code>str</code> should always be a
UTF-8 string (see ⚠️ below), which means that the length of a string in bytes may not necessarily be the same as its
length in characters.</p>
<p>For example (don’t worry about the code yet):</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let yuki = &quot;雪&quot;;

let byte_length = yuki.len();
println!(&quot;Length in bytes: {byte_length}&quot;);

let char_length = yuki.chars().count();
println!(&quot;Length in characters: {char_length}&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Its also worth remembering that when you turn a string into characters, each of those characters will take up 4 bytes
of memory, even though inside the string they might have only taken up one byte (again, don’t worry about the code in
the next example we’ll talk about it soon):</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">use std::mem::size_of_val;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let hello = &quot;hello&quot;;

let string_size = size_of_val(hello);
println!(&quot;Size as string slice: {string_size} bytes&quot;);

// Convert the string slice to chars, get the size of each char, and sum them
let  char_size: usize = hello.chars().map(|c| size_of_val(&amp;c)).sum();
println!(&quot;Size as characters: {char_size} bytes&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The size of a string slice depends on what’s in it, which is why you won’t see it on the stack (string slices live in
either the compiled output as string literals, or on the Heap inside a String). A string slice reference is made up of
two pieces of data, a pointer to where the string slice starts, and a length, both of which are of known size but depend
on the system architecture.</p>
<p>Fun fact about that reference though: you might wonder if it’s just a pointer and a length, does that mean you can
have a reference to a string slice that exists inside a string slice, and the answer is: yes! Just be careful when
taking a slice inside a slice to make sure that the sub slice is a valid UTF-8 string.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ It is <em>possible</em> to create a string slice that is not a valid UTF-8 string so you should be mindful that this isn’t
a guarantee, but you also shouldn’t make the effort to check the validity everywhere its used. It <em>should</em> be a UTF-8
string, but if you are constructing your own from raw data, or if there are security implications to the use of a
string slice, you should be careful.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let hello = &quot;hello&quot;;
// hell is a reference to a substring, range 0..4 is exclusive so 0, 1, 2, 3 but not 4
let hell = &amp;hello[0..4]; 
println!(&quot;{hell}&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="compound-types"><a class="header" href="#compound-types">Compound Types</a></h2>
<h3 id="arrays"><a class="header" href="#arrays">Arrays</a></h3>
<p>Arrays are a collection of a single type. You might see arrays in two forms, either as a sized array on the stack, or
as a reference to another collection (also called an array slice).</p>
<p>When sized, arrays are annotated with the type <code>[T; N]</code> where <code>T</code> is the type of every item in the array and <code>N</code> is its
size. For example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let hello: [char; 5] = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'];
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>When referenced as an array slice, you do not need to specify the size because, just like with references to string
slices, the reference not only contains a pointer to the underlying data, but also contains the size. We write this in
the form <code>&amp;[T]</code> where <code>T</code> is the type of every item in the array.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">let hello: [char; 5] = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'];
</span>// hell is a reference to a sub-array, range 0..=3 is inclusive so 0, 1, 2, and 3
let hell: &amp;[char] = &amp;hello[0..=3];

// This is another way of printing variables with debug that we haven't covered yet 
print!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, hell);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>You can access elements inside the array directly by using an index value between square brackets. In Rust, indexing
starts at 0. So:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let hello: [char; 5] = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'];
let h = hello[0]; // H
let e = hello[1]; // e 
let l = hello[2]; // l 
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<h3 id="tuples"><a class="header" href="#tuples">Tuples</a></h3>
<p>Tuples are similar to arrays in that they are a collection of items, however each item in the collection can be a
different type. This adds some flexibility but also some restrictions. For example, you can iterate over each item in
an array, but not a tuple.</p>
<p>Tuples are written between brackets, and are only considered the same type if the types inside the tuple match.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let char_int_1: (char, i32) = ('a', 1);
let char_int_2: (char, i32) = ('b', 2); // This type is the same as the previous one.
let int_char_1: (i32, char) = (3, 'c'); // This type is different 
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Another difference from arrays is how you access a single item in the tuple, which you do with a dot <code>.</code>, followed by
the number element you want. Again, this starts from 0.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let char_int: (char, i32) = ('a', 1);
let a = char_int.0;
let one = char_int.1;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<h4 id="the-unit-type"><a class="header" href="#the-unit-type">The Unit Type</a></h4>
<p>The Unit Type is a zero length tuple <code>()</code> that is Rust’s way to represent nothing. It is zero bytes, does not exist on
the stack at runtime, and unlike other languages with types like <code>null</code> or <code>void</code>, can not be used interchangeably with
other types.</p>
<h3 id="structs"><a class="header" href="#structs">Structs</a></h3>
<p>Structs are similar to tuples in that they are a type made up of other types. Unlike tuples they are named though. There
are three types of structs, structs with named fields, tuple structs and unit structs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> types like structs and enums must be declared outside of functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="tuple-struct"><a class="header" href="#tuple-struct">Tuple Struct</a></h4>
<p>As we just covered tuples, lets quickly talk about tuple structs. They look a bit like they’re simply “named” tuples,
and indeed they can be accessed the same way:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">struct Vector3(f64, f64, f64);

fn main() {
    let vec = Vector3(10.0, 2.0, 3.33);
    let ten = vec.0;
    let two = vec.1;
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Similar to tuples, this kind of struct can be accessed with a <code>.</code> and a numbered value, <em>however</em> unlike structs,
structs have a concept of “visibility”. Unless explicitly marked as public the fields of a struct are only accessible
in the module in which it is defined, or its descendents. We’ll talk more about modules later, however, to make the
fields of a struct public, you can simply mark them as <code>pub</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct Vector3(pub f64, pub f64, pub f64);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>You don’t have to make every field public though, if you’d some parts of the struct to be public and others to be
private.</p>
<h4 id="named-fields"><a class="header" href="#named-fields">Named Fields</a></h4>
<p>Named fields work pretty much the same as tuple structs except instead of having a numbered field, its named. You
can access the named field with a <code>.</code> and the name.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">struct Cell {
    x: u64,
    y: u64,
    alive: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let cell = Cell {
        x: 10,
        y: 123,
        alive: true,
    };

    let is_alive = cell.alive;
}</code></pre></pre>
<h4 id="unit-structs"><a class="header" href="#unit-structs">Unit Structs</a></h4>
<p>Unit structs are an interesting case that you probably won’t find much use for until we get into more advanced Rust and
some of the cooler patterns and idioms that we use. A Unit struct has no value, it only represents a type.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">struct ExampleUnitStruct;

fn main() {
    let unit_struct = ExampleUnitStruct;
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Unit Structs have zero size and don’t exist on the stack at runtime, but they can have functionality added to them
through Traits, or be used as markers.</p>
<h3 id="enums"><a class="header" href="#enums">Enums</a></h3>
<p>Enums are for when you want to represent one of a finite number of possible values. For example</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">enum TrafficLightState {
    Red,
    Amber,
    Green,
}

fn main() {
    let green = TrafficLightState::Green;
    // let purple = TrafficLightState::Purple; // Won't compile
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Many programing languages have this concept of enums, but what makes Rust enums especially awesome is that the variants
can additionally contain values. We’ve already talked about two such enums <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> which are two of the
most important and widely used types in the entire ecosystem, and we’ll talk more about them in the Generic Types
section below. As an example though, enums variants can be structured in either a tuple stype or a struct style:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">enum ContrivedEnum {
    SimpleVariantNoData,
    TupleStyleData(u64, i32),
    NamedFields {
        time: i128,
        place: String,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let simple_variant = ContrivedEnum::SimpleVariantNoData;
    let tuple_style = ContrivedEnum::TupleStyleData(10, -20);
    let named_fields = ContrivedEnum::NamedFields {
        time: 1_710_000_000_000,
        place: &quot;Here&quot;.to_string(),
    };
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In terms of memory usage, on the stack an enum will take up as much space as its largest variant, regardless of which
variant it actually is.</p>
<h2 id="generic-types"><a class="header" href="#generic-types">Generic Types</a></h2>
<p>Generics in Rust allow the creation of entirely new types at compile time by combining types together. We’ve talked
a bit about Option and how Rust uses it to represent Some value or None. Option is an enum with two variants, it is
literally just this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>enum Option&lt;T&gt; {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that after the name of the enum we have <code>&lt;T&gt;</code>. The triangle brackets express that this enum has a type (or types)
that can be decided later, the <code>T</code> is a marker for that type. For example, say we want to create a type that represents
either a single character, or nothing.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// The type of possible_character is inferred to be Option&lt;char&gt;
let possible_character = Some('r');

// The type of no_character can not be inferred, but you can annotate it yourself
let no_character: Option&lt;char&gt; = None;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Normally when accessing the variants of an enum, you must use the name followed by the variant (eg <code>Option::Some('r')</code>),
however Option and Result are so ubiquitous that their variants are globally accessible in any rust code.</p>
<p>Another generic we’ve covered before is Result which usually represents either the success or failure of a function. It
has two types that can be decided later <code>T</code>, which should represent what type of data you expected to get back, and <code>E</code>,
which will be the type of the Error.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>enum Result&lt;T, E&gt; {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We’ll talk more about functions in the next chapter, but in order to explain Result in context, the following example
shows the fully described Result type as the return type of the function, which is how we’d typically use this enum,
though, you wouldn’t typically use a String as an Error type, and we’ll talk more about that when we get to Error
handling later.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn function_that_fails_half_the_time() -&gt; Result&lt;u128, String&gt; { // Note the return type for a function comes after -&gt;
    let time = std::time::UNIX_EPOCH
        .elapsed()
        .expect(&quot;Call the doctor, time went backwards&quot;) // We can do something cooler here but that's for another time
        .as_millis();

    if time % 2 == 0 {
        Ok(time) // implicit return
    } else {
        Err(&quot;The function failed&quot;.to_string()) // implicit return
    }
} 
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>When we start talking about adding functionality to traits in the next chapter, we’ll also talk about how you can
restrict what types are allowed to be used in generics through the use of trait bounds.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>That is (almost) everything you need to know about types! The main thing we’re still missing in ownership, but we’ll
come to that later. The main things to remember are:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have our primitive types that represent binary data. There’s a lot of choice here, but that’s a good thing!</li>
<li>We can represent more complex types with compound types, each with its own use</li>
<li>We can “fill in the blank” with compound types later using generics</li>
<li>We talked a bit about two of the most common generics, Option (representing something or nothing) and Result
(representing a successful value or an error)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next chapter we’re going to talk about controlling the flow of our program with branches and loops as well as
introducing functions.</p>
