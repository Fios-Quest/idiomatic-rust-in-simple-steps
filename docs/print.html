<p>Welcome to IRISS 👁️🦀</p>
<p>Rust has a reputation of being difficult to learn, certainly it was when I learned back in 2017. While its true that
there remain some rough edges, the language is now easier to pick up than ever, and in many ways is much easier than
a lot of more established languages.</p>
<p>The goal of this series is to help you go from no knowledge of Rust to understanding how Rust is written as quickly as
possible.</p>
<p>This book is the written version of a companion 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW2L8KbM0O7aRi_Bt4YE1JuW9EdMs0ztR" title="" target="_blank">YouTube series</a> (coming soon)</p>
<p>If you spot a problem with this guide (I’m only human 😅), please file an Issue or even a PR on the
<a href="https://github.com/Gisleburt/idiomatic-rust-in-simple-steps" title="" target="_blank">project repository</a> and I will be incredibly grateful.
I certainly don’t know <em>everything</em> about Rust and look forward to learning new things throughout this project.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you should start by <a href="./introduction/why.html">deciding if Rust is definitely the language for you</a>, and
what <a href="./introduction/resources.html">other learning resources</a> are available.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-or-why-not"><a class="header" href="#why-or-why-not">Why or Why Not</a></h1>
<ol>
<li><a href="introduction/why.html#why-rust">Why Rust</a></li>
<li><a href="introduction/why.html#why-not-rust">Why not Rust</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-rust"><a class="header" href="#why-rust">Why Rust</a></h2>
<p>I could tell you that it’s a “blazingly fast” language, that holds your hand and helps reduce bugs, that its first party
tooling is second to none, that it has a mature ecosystem and an amazing community. These are all good reasons to
consider using Rust for any personal or professional project. There is, however, in my mind, a singular reason everyone
should consider learning Rust:</p>
<p><strong>Because its fun</strong></p>
<p>Seriously, Rust is my happy place. Sure it has its frustrations like any language, but when I work with Rust I <em>feel</em>
smart, I have less horrible surprises, and I have a lot of confidence that my code will “just work”, that I won’t need
to come back to fix bugs and if I do, I will be able to quickly understand old code, write new tests and fix any
problems.</p>
<p>And, I’m not alone, since its 1.0 release Rust has been Stack Overflows “most loved” (now “most admired”) language eight
years in a row. This isn’t derived from fanatics like me just saying “its great” but is the percentage of people who
used the language this year, that still want to use it next year.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-rust"><a class="header" href="#why-not-rust">Why not Rust</a></h2>
<p>As much as I love Rust, there is a reason it may not be the language for you… and it’s a <em>big</em> one.</p>
<p>If you are specifically looking to learn a language to get a job (and you’re not interested in Blockchain) Rust is not
going to be a good language… for now. The irony of “professional Rust” is that Rust engineers think there are no Rust
employers, and Rust employers think there are no Rust engineers <em>because</em> very few of us are interested in Blockchain
technologies.</p>
<p>That said, things have been slowly changing. More businesses are picking it up due to its low cost to write, run and
maintain. The main cost to adopting Rust remains the cost of training people, but there are more and more of us out
there and perhaps 2024 will finally be the tipping point. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, right now, if you’re looking for a job,
<a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-language-prof" title="" target="_blank">better languages to learn</a> would be
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org" title="" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> or <a href="https://www.python.org" title="" target="_blank">Python</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="other-learning-resources"><a class="header" href="#other-learning-resources">Other Learning Resources</a></h1>
<p>Its worth mentioning that there are many other Rust learning resources out there, so if this guide ends up not working
out for you, or you’re looking to supplement it with other sources, these are in my mind, the (other) best ways to learn
the Rust.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="introduction/resources.html#the-official-book">The official book</a></li>

</ol>
<h2 id="the-official-book"><a class="header" href="#the-official-book">The official book</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/" title="" target="_blank">The Rust Programming Language</a> book is the official way to learn, and will be the
most complete guide. This is how I learned the language way back in 2017 and its gotten significantly better since then.
The main difference between the official book and this guide is that the official book focuses on teaching you how the
language works, while this guide is focused on how the language is written, only looping back to how the language works
to explain why we write it that way. This guide tries to follow a similar path to the official book and to Rustlings,
see below, so it should be easy to jump between them.</p>
<h2 id="rustlings"><a class="header" href="#rustlings">Rustlings</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/" title="" target="_blank">Rustlings</a> is a “learn by doing” guide to Rust. It works by giving you
specific exercises to help you understand the language a bit at a time.</p>
<p>The gamification of the course makes it really fun, so I still use Rustlings to help keep myself sharp.</p>
<h2 id="rust-by-example"><a class="header" href="#rust-by-example">Rust by Example</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/" title="" target="_blank">Rust by Example</a> does exactly what it says on the tin. It focuses on
the implementation of the Rust language.</p>
<p>This is great to quickly look things up if you know what you want to know, however, there’s some minor
pseudo-anti-patterns here that if you don’t already know are anti-patterns, you might be tempted to copy-paste. Don’t
worry though, we’ll cover these here but also tools like Clippy (which we’ll also cover) will be quick to point them
out.</p>
<h2 id="idiomatic-rust-in-simple-steps-1"><a class="header" href="#idiomatic-rust-in-simple-steps-1">Idiomatic Rust in Simple Steps</a></h2>
<p>So, why use IRISS if there are these other great resources?</p>
<p>Idiomatic Rust in Simple Steps lines up nicely with these other resources and can supplement them or vice versa. While
the other resources focus on simply learning the language, IRISS focuses on how and why we write the language the way
we do. This might seem like the same thing, but here we’ll ramp up on idioms quickly so that you can understand other
peoples code as well as write code that other people can understand.</p>
<p>This matters!</p>
<p>My biggest hot take of the software industry is that: Software engineers are not paid to write code, they’re paid to
solve problems.</p>
<p>The best engineers I’ve worked with have solved problems without writing a single line of code, and the cheapest code to
maintain is the code you didn’t write. Beyond this though, solving problems, even with code, takes understanding and
collaboration. If when you join a team you already understand why they write code the way they do, you’re going to
become productive much faster.</p>

<h2 id="mac-and-linux"><a class="header" href="#mac-and-linux">Mac and Linux</a></h2>
<p>Before you begin, you need to make sure you have the appropriate build tools.</p>
<p>For Mac, make sure to run <code>xcode-select install</code></p>
<p>For Linux, you need to install gcc via your package manage, for example, on a Raspberry Pi, you might do 
<code>sudo apt install gcc</code></p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://rustup.rs" title="" target="_blank">https://rustup.rs</a>, copy the command displayed there into your terminal.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/images/rustup-mac.png" alt="Rustup Mac / Linux" /></p>
<p>You will be given the option for customizing the installation, but we don’t need to do that for now</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# [other information about the install appears here]

Current installation options:


   default host triple: x86_64-apple-darwin
     default toolchain: stable (default)
               profile: default
  modify PATH variable: yes

1) Proceed with installation (default)
2) Customize installation
3) Cancel installation
&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Choose 1 and wait for installation to complete. To immediately use Rust’s tools now, you will need to run the command it
tells you to run at the end of the installer, however, you should only need to do this once as the installer makes the
changes necessary for new terminal sessions to pick up on the changes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ source &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can check whether everything has installed properly by running <code>cargo version</code> and you should see something
like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo version
cargo 1.75.0 (1d8b05cdd 2023-11-20)
</code></pre>
<p>Cargo is the main tool we’ll use to build and work with Rust, you will need at least version <code>1.75</code> for this tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="windows"><a class="header" href="#windows">Windows</a></h2>
<p>Installing Rust on Windows is a bit more challenging, but you’ve got this, I believe in you.</p>
<p>All the important differences for Windows are explained on <a href="https://rustup.rs" title="" target="_blank">rustup.rs</a>, however, I personally
struggled a bit with this, so I’m laying it out here in my own words.</p>
<h3 id="windows-build-tools"><a class="header" href="#windows-build-tools">Windows Build Tools</a></h3>
<p>The first thing we’re going to need are some Microsoft build tools. </p>
<p>Head to <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/" title="" target="_blank">https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/</a> and download the 
community edition.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/windows-visual-studio-community.png" alt="windows-visual-studio-community.png" /></p>
<p>The installer is the gateway to a huge number of tools and software, but we only need two things.</p>
<p>Click through to the Individual Components tab, and search for the following: <code>C++ x64/x86 build tools</code></p>
<p>Select the latest version.</p>
<p>Next search for: <code>Windows SDK</code></p>
<p>Select the latest version of the SDK for your version of Windows.</p>
<p>Finally, click install. You may get a prompt asking if you’d like to continue without workloads, which you do,
so continue.</p>
<p>The installation itself can take a while so grab a tea or something ☕</p>
<h3 id="rustup"><a class="header" href="#rustup">Rustup</a></h3>
<p>Once the Windows build tools are installed, head back to <a href="https://rustup.rs" title="" target="_blank">rustup.rs</a> and download <code>rustup-init.exe</code>.
Running this will install the tools we need.</p>
<p>Choose the default install options.</p>
<p>Once complete, we can check that things have been installed correctly by opening either <code>cmd</code> or <code>powershell</code> or your
terminal of choice, and run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">cargo version
</code></pre>
<h3 id="gcc-optional-but-recommended"><a class="header" href="#gcc-optional-but-recommended">GCC (optional, but recommended)</a></h3>
<p>Wait, the rustup website doesn’t mention this!</p>
<p>I know, and you don’t <em>necessarily</em> need to do this. However, Rust is a language that can interop with other languages.
In particular, Rust works really well with existing C and C++ libraries, however, Windows and Linux us different C++
libraries. This can be fixed by installing <code>gcc</code>.</p>
<p>Like Microsoft’s build tools, gcc isn’t packaged by itself, but unlike Microsoft’s build tools there are many, many ways
to install it.</p>
<p>The easiest way I’ve found is to install the <a href="https://scoop.sh" title="" target="_blank">Scoop</a> package manager by following the instructions on
their website.</p>
<p>Once installed, all you need to do is run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">scoop install main/gcc
</code></pre>
<p>You can check this worked by running <code>gcc --version</code></p>
<p>Phew! That’s it, congratulations! It took me over an hour to do this on my first attempt.</p>
<p>If you haven’t done already, its a good idea to restart your computer before moving on.</p>

<h2 id="visual-studio-code"><a class="header" href="#visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</a></h2>
<p>A software developers environment is something very specific to them. Some people love vim and neovim, others like Nova,
I’m personally a big fan of IntelliJ. If you’ve already found the tools for you, there’s no wrong answer here, use
whatever makes you happy.</p>
<p>If you’re new to software engineering though, and not looking to fork out potentially hundreds of dollars on tooling,
I recommend Visual Studio Code. It’s free, is perhaps the most widely used and supported editor today, and can be
greatly extended through plugins.</p>
<p>It’s the editor I’ll be using throughout this series as I believe it will be the most familiar to people.</p>
<p>To get started head over to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" title="" target="_blank">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a> and download the right
version for your device.</p>
<p>After installing it, we will need some plugins to work with Rust. To get to extensions, open VSCode and press the
extensions button in the sidebar (by default the sidebar is on the left).</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/images/vscode-extensions.png" alt="VSCode Extensions" /></p>
<h2 id="extensions"><a class="header" href="#extensions">Extensions</a></h2>
<h3 id="rust-analyzer"><a class="header" href="#rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a></h3>
<p>Rust Analyzer will provide the bulk of language support that we’ll need. It’ll give us auto complete, syntax
highlighting and symbol editing that will just make our lives a lot easier. Search for <code>rust-analyzer</code> in the search
bar at the top of the extensions tab and click install.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/images/vscode-extension-rust-analyzer.png" alt="vscode-extension-rust-analyzer.png" /></p>
<h3 id="codelldb"><a class="header" href="#codelldb">CodeLLDB</a></h3>
<p>As we learn any new language, one of the most important things for us to be able to do is see what’s actually happening.
CodeLLDB allows us to pause a program while its running and see what its doing. This lets us check that a program is
doing what we think its doing.</p>

<h3 id="even-better-toml"><a class="header" href="#even-better-toml">Even Better TOML</a></h3>
<p>The Rust ecosystem makes heavy use of the TOML file format. We’ll talk about this more much later on but now is a good
time to pick up this extension.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/images/vscode-extension-toml.png" alt="vscode-extension-toml.png" /></p>
<h3 id="crates"><a class="header" href="#crates">crates</a></h3>
<p>Rust developers share code through a mechanism called Crates. This extension will help us keep any crates we depend on
up to date. We won’t be using crates for a while, but it’s good to grab now. </p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hello-world"><a class="header" href="#hello-world">Hello World</a></h1>
<p>Now that we’re finally set up, lets create our first program. As is tradition, our first program is simply going to
print the words <code>Hello, world!</code>.</p>

<p>Open Visual Studio Code and open the terminal.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you’re new to Visual Studio Code and you want the editor to do something (say, for example, open a
terminal), hold <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Shift</code> and press <code>P</code> (or <code>Cmd</code> + <code>Shift</code> and press <code>P</code> on Mac). You can then type the thing
you want to do, and it should show up in the list. Sometimes, like with Terminal, you might get a lot of results and
the one you want might need a little scroll. Normally for a Terminal you want to use it internally, so you’d scroll to
<code>Terminal: Create New Terminal</code></p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/vscode-any-command-terminal.png" alt="Open the terminal" /></p>
<p>Navigate to an appropriate location for your projects such as your home directory or my documents, depending on your
system.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this on Mac and Linux is to do <code>cd ~</code></p>
<p>There isn’t really an equivalent on Windows, so if you aren’t sure you can instead use Explorer to open My Documents,
right-click an empty space in the window, click “More Options” then “Open in Terminal”</p>
<p>Run <code>cargo new hello-world</code>, and cargo will report that it has created the project</p>
<p>Cargo is the program we’ll use to run our rust programs as well as many of the rust tools that will help us along the
way.</p>
<p>Now in Visual Studio Code, go to File -&gt; Open Folder and navigate to the hello-world folder we just created.</p>
<p>You can see that cargo has created some files for us. We’re going to talk about the cargo files later but for now,
head into the <code>src</code> directory and open main.rs</p>
<p>You can see the file has already been created with the following code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Before we dive into this further, lets run the program.</p>
<p>Open the terminal again, as we did before. This time use <code>cargo run</code> to run our program, you should see something like
the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cargo run
   Compiling hello-world v0.1.0 (D:\Documents\hello-world)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33s
     Running `target\debug\hello-world.exe`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Well, that was easy 😅</p>
<p>You’ll find the Rust community has put a lot of effort into making Rust as easy as possible to learn and use.</p>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-hello-world"><a class="header" href="#anatomy-of-hello-world">Anatomy of Hello World</a></h2>
<p>Let’s talk about hello world.</p>
<p>The first line <code>fn main()</code> describes a function (fn) called main. Functions are a useful way to group up a bit of code
to be called elsewhere. We’ll talk more about the power of functions and when to use them in a future chapter. For now
all we need to know is that the main function is called when the program starts, so any code we put in here will run.</p>
<p>At the moment, the only line of code is <code>println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);</code>. A lot of engineers might assume this is how we
call functions in Rust, and that <code>println</code> is the function name. However, the exclamation mark actually tells us this
is a macro. Macros are very powerful and can do much more than functions, however they are an advanced topic, and we
won’t be creating our own until much later. We will be using pre-written macros a fair bit though.</p>
<p><code>println!</code> will write what it’s given to the console.</p>
<h2 id="running-and-debugging-rust"><a class="header" href="#running-and-debugging-rust">Running and Debugging Rust</a></h2>
<p>Before we end this section, I want to quickly set up one of the most powerful tools we have thats going to help us
learn incredibly quickly.</p>
<p>First let’s make a quick change to our program, by adding a variable with our name, and then saying hello to ourselves
instead of the whole world</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let name = &quot;Daniel&quot;;
    println!(&quot;Hello, {name}!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Fun fact, Rust uses utf-8 strings when written like this, so don’t worry if your name can not be properly represented in
American English characters. For example, I might naively write my cats name like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let name = &quot;ユキ&quot;;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>However, this won’t actually output correctly unless your system is set up to display it (thanks Windows).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hover the mouse over the <code>3</code> denoting line 3 (where the <code>println!</code> should be) you should see a little red dot  appear.
Click this dot to set a break point. When debugging code, the debugger will pause at break points allowing us to see
what’s actually happening.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/vscode-breakpoint.png" alt="Breakpoints" /></p>
<p>To debug our code press F5… and it will immediately show you an error. Don’t panic! This is where CodeLLDB is going
to do some magic for us. The error is because we didn’t set a default run configuration, click OK and Visual Studio Code
will ask if you want to generate one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Depending on your personal configuration, it may ask you want to create the configuration from. If you
are asked this, click <code>LLDB</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click “yes”, then press F5 again, and the program will start and then pause when it hits line 3.</p>
<p>If you mouse over <code>name</code> on either line 2 or line 3, you’ll see its value. Being able to see what’s happening in a
running program is a programming superpower.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/vscode-debug.png" alt="Breakpoints" /></p>
<p>To let the program continue, hit F5 one more time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="language-basics"><a class="header" href="#language-basics">Language Basics</a></h1>
<p>In this section we’re going to step through the language basics, attempting to cover enough to quickly move on to
language idioms. By doing this, we hope that people won’t end up with a lot of bad habits (like some of us did) as the
“easy” bits that help you get started end up overly ingrained in your memory.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="guessing-game"><a class="header" href="#guessing-game">Guessing Game</a></h1>
<p>We’re going to start in the same place as the official Rust book,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html" title="" target="_blank">with a guessing game</a>! However, we’re going to
do things a little bit differently.</p>
<p>We’ll start as we did with Hello World, and create a new project with cargo</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo new guessing-game
</code></pre>
<p>Opening <code>src/main.rs</code> we#ll see the same code as before:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>As we step through this tutorial, if you mouse over the code examples, you can see some buttons that will let you</p>
<ol>
<li>⎘ Copy the example to your clipboard</li>
<li>⏵ Run the example via <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org" title="" target="_blank">rust playground</a> (where possible)</li>
<li>👁 Show any code I’ve opted to hide for clarity, try this on the next block</li>
</ol>
<p>Lets quickly change our hello world message to something that welcomes us to the game.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    println!(&quot;Welcome to the guessing game!&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>And a quick description:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Welcome to the guessing game!&quot;);
</span>    println!(&quot;I have chosen a number between 1 and 100, can you guess it?&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Lets pick a number that the user has to guess, something between 1 and 100 would be nice, and I’m going to stick this
at the top of the function (don’t forget you can click the 👁 on the example to see)</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let actual = 53;
<span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Welcome to the guessing game!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;I have chosen a number between 1 and 100, can you guess it?&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In Rust, variables have a “type”, that is to say, they have certain behaviors and representations depending on the type.
By default, a number is represented as an <code>i32</code>, that is a 32 bit signed integer. This means that it can represent a 
number between <code>-2,147,483,648</code> and <code>2,147,483,647</code>.</p>
<p>There are many other ways to represent numbers, from big to small, positive only or allowing negative numbers, allowing
decimal places or exactly sized to system memory. We’ll talk more about how to specify the type and how to decide the
right number type for you next time, but for now an <code>i32</code> is just fine.</p>
<p>Lets output the number (even though we haven’t asked for a guess yet)</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let actual = 53;
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Welcome to the guessing game!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;I have chosen a number between 1 and 100, can you guess it?&quot;);
</span>    println!(&quot;The number I chose was {actual}&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Great… not much of a game is it.</p>
<p>In order to get some user input, we need to read from the terminal. Before we tell the user what the actual number was
lets ask them to guess</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let actual = 53;
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Welcome to the guessing game!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;I have chosen a number between 1 and 100, can you guess it?&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">   
</span>    println!(&quot;Enter a number between 1 and 100&quot;);
<span class="boring">   
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;The number I chose was {actual}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>We’re then going to read a line of input from the user. When the program runs in the terminal, we can ask the user to
type things, regardless of whether you are on Windows, Mac or Linux, this input is passed into the program through a
stream of data called <code>stdin</code> (standard in).</p>
<p>Rust comes with a “standard library” that we can access through <code>std</code>. I always say S T D, but you may also here people
call it “stud”. Inside of this is a module (a grouping) called io that deals with input and output. If we weren’t using
the <code>println!</code> macro, this is where we’d have to come to write things out to the terminal too, via a stream called 
<code>stdout</code> (standard out). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For completions sake I should mention there is one more stream called <code>stderr</code> (standard error). This is also an
output stream that we can use to separate “good” output that is relevant to the normal use of the program to really 
any other kind of output, whether that be errors or just information not directly relevant to the main output.</p>
<p>For example, on Mac and Linux, if you use <code>cargo run 2&gt; /dev/null</code> to run your program, you’ll see that you lose the
messages about your program being compiled because we redirected stderr (stream 2) to the void of <code>/dev/null</code>, and
Cargo sensibly decided that <em>it’s</em> output is not relevant to your programs normal output</p>
<p>On Windows the same can be achieved in cmd using <code>cargo run 2&gt; nul</code> (note, only one l in nul), or in powershell with
<code>cargo run 2&gt; $null</code> (two l’s this time and a dollar, no idea why its different)</p>
<p>There are more streams, denoted by numbers, but these are rarely used and are way outside of the scope of this series.</p>
<p><code>stderr</code> is really useful for things like logging and we’ll talk more about streams in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we get stdin using <code>std::io::stdin()</code>, this is a function call that returns a temporary handle to the input stream.</p>
<p>The double colons just tell Rust that you’re looking for something inside a module (that grouping I mentioned). We’ll 
cover modules in detail later, including how, why and when to make your own, as well as better ways to access them, but
since we only need to write this line once, this is fine.</p>
<p>Off the back of this, we can call <code>.lines()</code> which is a method (a special type of function that belongs specifically to
some other thing, in this case the handle to that data). Below I put this on a new line for legibility, but you don’t
need to do this.</p>
<p><code>.lines()</code> returns an iterator, something we can step through a bit at a time. In this case, if the input was multiple
lines then the iterator would return one line at a time. We get the next line by calling <code>.next()</code> on the iterator.</p>
<p>If we add this all in our code looks like this</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let actual = 53;
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Welcome to the guessing game!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;I have chosen a number between 1 and 100, can you guess it?&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">   
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Enter a number between 1 and 100&quot;);
</span>    let input = std::io::stdin()
            .lines()
            .next()
            .expect(&quot;No input read&quot;)
            .expect(&quot;Could not get input from stdin&quot;);
    println!(&quot;Your guess was {input}&quot;);
<span class="boring">   
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;The number I chose was {actual}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>Wait wait wait, what are those <code>expect</code>s about?!</p>
<p>In software, functions can sometimes return something or nothing, and sometimes they could work or not work. These two
expects handle one case of each.</p>
<p>The first expect then:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">.expect(&quot;No input read&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>When we call <code>.next()</code> on any iterator, there either is something next or there isn’t. In some languages this
might return either the data you expect, or a <code>null</code> value. This means you must either manually check the thing returned
was null, or don’t check, and risk your program breaking at some other point when it expected that data but got null
instead. Obviously many people think this ambiguity is bad, including Tony Hoare, arguably the “inventor” of this kind
of behavior, who has called it his “billion-dollar mistake”.</p>
<p>Rust does not allow you to use types like this interchangeably, the type can not be something or nothing, it must be
something that represents the concept of something or nothing, in this case a type called <code>Option</code>. Importantly the
<code>Option</code> itself is not the data you were expecting, so you are forced to check whether it contains that data before you
can use it. </p>
<p>The idiomatic way to do this depends on whether your code can recover from the data not being there. In our case we’re
going to just say we can’t deal with it not being there, we don’t want to continue running the program and we want the
program to stop. We use <code>.expect(&quot;message&quot;)</code> to say, if this is nothing, we are giving up, stop the program and print
our message (plus a few other useful bits) to the <code>stderr</code> (see above).</p>
<p>This still isn’t very idiomatic, ideally we’d convert the bad behavior into a proper error and handle it more sensibly
but for now its passable. Maybe… we’ll fix this later. :)</p>
<p>Speaking of proper errors:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">.expect(&quot;Could not get input from stdin&quot;);</code></pre>
<p>If the Option we got from <code>.next()</code> contains something instead of nothing, it <em>still</em> doesn’t actually the users input.
It turns out that reading data from <code>stdin</code> is itself fallible.</p>
<p>Fallibility in programming is another thing we’ve traditionally handled very badly. A common way to deal with this in
other languages is to stop executing and “throw” an error. The big problem with this is function you are calling does
not explicitly tell you that its fallible (may fail). Worse, it may be that the person who wrote that function didn’t
even know because the fallibility is deeply nested.</p>
<p>Rust does away with this with another type called <code>Result</code>. If your function can fail, it must return a Result type.
Like with <code>Option</code>, <code>Result</code> is its own type that contains either the data we wanted, or an error.</p>
<p>Again, the idiomatic way to handle this depends on what you’re trying to do, is the error recoverable, and how do we
want to report the error back to the user. Using <code>expect</code> will, again, cause the program to immediately stop with the
error message and other bits sent to <code>stderr</code>.</p>
<p>But anyway, we now have a working program, there is an actual number, the user guesses a number, we print both to the
screen.</p>
<h2 id="going-further"><a class="header" href="#going-further">Going Further</a></h2>
<p>The input data we get from the user is a string, not a number so, if I enter a string, it just prints that as my guess.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Welcome to the guessing game!
I have chosen a number between 1 and 100, can you guess it?
Enter a number between 1 and 100
obvious nonsense
Your guess was obvious nonsense
The number I chose was 53
</code></pre>
<p>Because <code>actual</code> is an “i32” and <code>input</code> is a “String”, we can’t simply compare them, we need to convert one type into
the other. We can do this with a method on strings called <code>.parse()</code>. As you can probably guess <code>parse</code> is fallible and
if we give it <code>&quot;obvious nonsense&quot;</code> it will error. We can deal with that with another <code>expect</code>.</p>
<p>There’s something else we need to do though, there are lots of things we could parse our string into, so we need to tell
Rust what we want. There’s a couple of ways to do this, but the most idiomatic way, and what we’ll do here, is just tell
Rust what the type of the variable is going to be, then Rust is smart enough to <code>parse</code> our String into that data.</p>
<p>Eg:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let guess: i32 = input.parse().expect(&quot;input was not a number&quot;);</code></pre>
<p>That’s pretty clean, right?</p>
<p>Now that the types are the same, we can do different things depending on whether the the numbers are a match. We can
do this with an <code>if</code> statement. You use an <code>if</code> by giving it something that will evaluate to either true or false. For
example <code>guess == actual</code> will be true if guess is exactly equal to actual, otherwise it will be false. We can follow
the <code>if</code> part immediately with an <code>else</code> that says what to do if the evaluation came to false.</p>
<p>Below is the full function using this if/else:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">fn main() {
    let actual = 53;

    println!(&quot;Welcome to the guessing game!&quot;);
    println!(&quot;I have chosen a number between 1 and 100, can you guess it?&quot;);

    println!(&quot;Enter a number between 1 and 100&quot;);
    let input = std::io::stdin()
        .lines()
        .next()
        .expect(&quot;No input read&quot;)
        .expect(&quot;Could not get input from stdin&quot;);

    let guess: i32 = input.parse().expect(&quot;input was not a number&quot;);

    if guess == actual {
        println!(&quot;Correct!&quot;)
    } else {
        println!(&quot;That was not correct, try again&quot;)
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Ok, not bad. This is a bit more game like. I’m not happy about that last expect though. Its quite likely that the user
will enter something thats not a number, even if its just to “try it out”. If you try it in your program, you’ll see
rather a lot of unnecessary output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Welcome to the guessing game!
I have chosen a number between 1 and 100, can you guess it?
Enter a number between 1 and 100
obvious nonsense
