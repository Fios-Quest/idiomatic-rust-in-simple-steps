<p>Welcome to IRISS 👁️🦀</p>
<p>Rust has a reputation of being difficult to learn, certainly it was when I learned back in 2017. While its true that
there remain some rough edges, the language is now easier to pick up than ever, and in many ways is much easier than
a lot of more established languages.</p>
<p>The goal of this series is to help you go from no knowledge of Rust to understanding how Rust is written as quickly as
possible.</p>
<p>This book is the written version of (hopefully) a companion YouTube series (coming soon 🤞🏻)</p>
<p>If you spot a problem with this guide (I’m only human 😅), please file an Issue or even a PR on the
<a href="https://github.com/Gisleburt/idiomatic-rust-in-simple-steps" title="" target="_blank">project repository</a> and I will be incredibly grateful.
I certainly don’t know <em>everything</em> about Rust and look forward to learning new things throughout this project.</p>

<li><a href="getting-started/why.html#why-not-rust">Why not Rust</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-rust"><a class="header" href="#why-rust">Why Rust</a></h2>
<p>I could tell you that it’s a “blazingly fast” language, that holds your hand and helps reduce bugs, that its first party
tooling is second to none, that it has a mature ecosystem and an amazing community. These are all good reasons to
consider using Rust for any personal or professional project. There is, however, in my mind, a singular reason everyone
should consider learning Rust:</p>
<p><strong>Because its fun</strong></p>
<p>Seriously, Rust is my happy place. Sure it has its frustrations like any language, but when I work with Rust I <em>feel</em>
smart, I have less horrible surprises, and I have a lot of confidence that my code will “just work”, that I won’t need
to come back to fix bugs and if I do, I will be able to quickly understand old code, write new tests and fix any
problems.</p>
<p>And, I’m not alone, since its 1.0 release Rust has been Stack Overflows “most loved” (now “most admired”) language eight
years in a row. This isn’t derived from fanatics like me just saying “its great” but is the percentage of people who
used the language this year, that still want to use it next year.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-rust"><a class="header" href="#why-not-rust">Why not Rust</a></h2>
<p>As much as I love Rust, there is a reason it may not be the language for you… and it’s a <em>big</em> one.</p>
<p>If you are specifically looking to learn a language to get a job (and you’re not interested in Blockchain) Rust is not
going to be a good language… for now. The irony of “professional Rust” is that Rust engineers think there are no Rust
employers, and Rust employers think there are no Rust engineers <em>because</em> very few of us are interested in Blockchain
technologies.</p>
<p>That said, things have been slowly changing. More businesses are picking it up due to its low cost to write, run and
maintain. The main cost to adopting Rust remains the cost of training people, but there are more and more of us out
there and perhaps 2024 will finally be the tipping point. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, right now, if you’re looking for a job,
<a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-language-prof" title="" target="_blank">better languages to learn</a> would be
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org" title="" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> or <a href="https://www.python.org" title="" target="_blank">Python</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="other-learning-resources"><a class="header" href="#other-learning-resources">Other Learning Resources</a></h1>
<p>Its worth mentioning that there are many other Rust learning resources out there, so if this guide ends up not working
out for you, or you’re looking to supplement it with other sources, these are in my mind, the (other) best ways to learn
the Rust.</p>

<h2 id="the-official-book"><a class="header" href="#the-official-book">The official book</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/" title="" target="_blank">The Rust Programming Language</a> book is the official way to learn, and will be the
most complete guide. This is how I learned the language way back in 2017 and its gotten significantly better since then.
The main difference between the official book and this guide is that the official book focuses on teaching you how the
language works, while this guide is focused on how the language is written, only looping back to how the language works
to explain why we write it that way. This guide tries to follow a similar path to the official book and to Rustlings,
see below, so it should be easy to jump between them.</p>
<h2 id="rustlings"><a class="header" href="#rustlings">Rustlings</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/" title="" target="_blank">Rustlings</a> is a “learn by doing” guide to Rust. It works by giving you
specific exercises to help you understand the language a bit at a time.</p>
<p>The gamification of the course makes it really fun, so I still use Rustlings to help keep myself sharp.</p>
<p>There is also an <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16631-learn-rust/about" title="" target="_blank">IntelliJ Edu adaptation</a> of Rustlings so
if you install the free Community version of IntelliJ IDEA, you can have an in editor tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="rust-by-example"><a class="header" href="#rust-by-example">Rust by Example</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/" title="" target="_blank">Rust by Example</a> does exactly what it says on the tin. It focuses on
the implementation of the Rust language.</p>
<p>This is great to quickly look things up if you know what you want to know, however, there’s some minor
pseudo-anti-patterns here that if you don’t already know are anti-patterns, you might be tempted to copy-paste. Don’t
worry though, we’ll cover these here but also tools like Clippy (which we’ll also cover) will be quick to point them
out.</p>
<h2 id="idiomatic-rust-in-simple-steps-1"><a class="header" href="#idiomatic-rust-in-simple-steps-1">Idiomatic Rust in Simple Steps</a></h2>
<p>So, why use IRISS if there are these other great resources?</p>
<p>Idiomatic Rust in Simple Steps lines up nicely with these other resources and can supplement them or vice versa. While
the other resources focus on simply learning the language, IRISS focuses on how and why we write the language the way
we do. This might seem like the same thing, but here we’ll ramp up on idioms quickly so that you can understand other
peoples code as well as write code that other people can understand.</p>
<p>This matters!</p>
<p>My biggest hot take of the software industry is that: Software engineers are not paid to write code, they’re paid to
solve problems.</p>
<p>The best engineers I’ve worked with have solved problems without writing a single line of code, and the cheapest code to
maintain is the code you didn’t write. Beyond this though, solving problems, even with code, takes understanding and
collaboration. If when you join a team you already understand why they write code the way they do, you’re going to
become productive much faster.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://rustup.rs" title="" target="_blank">https://rustup.rs</a>, copy the command displayed there into your terminal.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/images/rustup-mac.png" alt="Rustup Mac / Linux" /></p>
<p>You will be given the option for customizing the installation, but we don’t need to do that for now</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# [other information about the install appears here]

Current installation options:


   default host triple: x86_64-apple-darwin
     default toolchain: stable (default)
               profile: default
  modify PATH variable: yes

1) Proceed with installation (default)
2) Customize installation
3) Cancel installation
&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Choose 1 and wait for installation to complete. To immediately use Rust’s tools now, you will need to run the command it
tells you to run at the end of the installer, however, you should only need to do this once as the installer makes the
changes necessary for new terminal sessions to pick up on the changes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ source &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can check whether everything has installed properly by running <code>cargo version</code> and you should see something
like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cargo version
cargo 1.75.0 (1d8b05cdd 2023-11-20)
</code></pre>
<p>Cargo is the main tool we’ll use to build and work with Rust, you will need at least version <code>1.75</code> for this tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="windows"><a class="header" href="#windows">Windows</a></h2>
<p>Installing Rust on Windows is a bit more challenging, but you’ve got this, I believe in you.</p>
<p>All the important differences for Windows are explained on <a href="https://rustup.rs" title="" target="_blank">rustup.rs</a>, however, I personally
struggled a bit with this, so I’m laying it out here in my own words.</p>
<h3 id="windows-build-tools"><a class="header" href="#windows-build-tools">Windows Build Tools</a></h3>
<p>The first thing we’re going to need are some Microsoft build tools. </p>
<p>Head to <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/" title="" target="_blank">https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/</a> and download the 
community edition.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/windows-visual-studio-community.png" alt="windows-visual-studio-community.png" /></p>
<p>The installer is the gateway to a huge number of tools and software, but we only need two things.</p>
<p>Click through to the Individual Components tab, and search for the following: <code>C++ x64/x86 build tools</code></p>
<p>Select the latest version.</p>
<p>Next search for: <code>Windows SDK</code></p>
<p>Select the latest version of the SDK for your version of Windows.</p>
<p>Finally, click install. You may get a prompt asking if you’d like to continue without workloads, which you do,
so continue.</p>
<p>The installation itself can take a while so grab a tea or something ☕</p>
<h3 id="rustup"><a class="header" href="#rustup">Rustup</a></h3>
<p>Once the Windows build tools are installed, head back to <a href="https://rustup.rs" title="" target="_blank">rustup.rs</a> and download <code>rustup-init.exe</code>.
Running this will install the tools we need.</p>
<p>Choose the default install options.</p>
<p>Once complete, we can check that things have been installed correctly by opening either <code>cmd</code> or <code>powershell</code> or your
terminal of choice, and run <code>cargo version</code>.</p>
<h3 id="gcc-optional-but-recommended"><a class="header" href="#gcc-optional-but-recommended">GCC (optional, but recommended)</a></h3>
<p>Wait, the rustup website doesn’t mention this!</p>
<p>I know, and you don’t <em>necessarily</em> need to do this. However, Rust is a language that can interop with other languages.
In particular, Rust works really well with existing C and C++ libraries, however, Windows and Linux us different C++
libraries. This can be fixed by installing <code>gcc</code>.</p>
<p>Like Microsoft’s build tools, gcc isn’t packaged by itself, but unlike Microsoft’s build tools there are many, many ways
to install it.</p>
<p>The easiest way I’ve found is to install <a href="https://www.msys2.org/" title="" target="_blank">MSYS2</a>, with two caveats. This will install more than
we need… and the installer doesn’t quite do everything you need. Don’t worry, we’ll step through it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🙏🏻 If anyone knows of a friendlier way of achieving this, please do open a PR or Issue 
<a href="https://github.com/Gisleburt/idiomatic-rust-in-simple-steps" title="" target="_blank">on this projects repository</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, grab the installer and follow the instruction. MSYS2 is a little fussy about where its installed, if in doubt
install it in the default location. Wherever you install it though, keep it in mind, we’ll need to find it shortly.</p>
<p>After installation but before we go further, we want to allow ourselves access to the tools that we’re going to install
inside MSYS2. To do that, you’ll need to find where it was installed, then go to the <code>ucrt64</code> directory, and then <code>bin</code>.
Copy the full path to this directory. You can do this by right-clicking the path, then clicking “Copy Address”</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/windows-msys2-bin.png" alt="MSYS2 bin path" /></p>
<p>Note, I installed mine to <code>D:/Programs/MYSYS64</code> but by default it will be <code>C:/MYSYS64</code></p>
<p>Next we need to add this to a system environment variable called <code>PATH</code>, this will allow us to access any tools in that
directory from anywhere in our system. To do this, go to the start menu, and simply type “environment” then click
“Edit the system environment variables”</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/windows-environment.png" alt="Finding Windows Environment" /></p>
<p>This, weirdly, doesn’t take you straight to environment variables but to system properties where you can click through
to the Environment variables at the bottom.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/windows-system-properties.png" alt="Windows System Properties" /></p>
<div class="warning">
Be careful here and don't change anything other than what we're here to change. Luckily the UI around this is very
sensible these days making it much harder to mess up.
</div>
<p>Select the Path variable in the top box, then hit edit.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/windows-environment-variables.png" alt="Windows System Properties" /></p>
<p>Now hit New on the right, and paste in the path as you can see I have done below</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/windows-edit-environment-variables.png" alt="Windows System Properties" /></p>
<p>Click OK to save the new path.</p>
<p>Finally, we’re ready to install gcc. Run the application <code>MSYS2 UCRT64</code> from the start menu. This is a specific
environmental setup for MSYS and will be the easiest to perform the next step in.</p>
<p>Enter the command <code>pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc</code>, hitting <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code> when it asks for confirmation. Pacman is the
package manager for MSYS and will install <code>gcc</code> and all of its dependencies.</p>
<p>You can check this worked by running <code>gcc --version</code></p>
<p>Phew! That’s it, congratulations! It took me over an hour to do this on my first attempt.</p>
<p>If you haven’t done already, its a good idea to restart your computer before moving on.</p>

<h2 id="visual-studio-code"><a class="header" href="#visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</a></h2>
<p>A software developers environment is something very specific to them. Some people love vim and neovim, others like Nova,
I’m personally a big fan of IntelliJ. If you’ve already found the tools for you, there’s no wrong answer here, use
whatever makes you happy.</p>
<p>If you’re new to software engineering though, and not looking to fork out potentially hundreds of dollars on tooling,
I recommend Visual Studio Code. It’s free, is perhaps the most widely used and supported editor today, and can be
greatly extended through plugins.</p>
<p>It’s the editor I’ll be using throughout this series as I believe it will be the most familiar to people.</p>
<p>To get started head over to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" title="" target="_blank">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a> and download the right
version for your device.</p>
<p>After installing it, we will need some plugins to work with Rust. To get to extensions, open VSCode and press the
extensions button in the sidebar (by default the sidebar is on the left).</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/images/vscode-extensions.png" alt="VSCode Extensions" /></p>
<h2 id="extensions"><a class="header" href="#extensions">Extensions</a></h2>
<h3 id="rust-analyzer"><a class="header" href="#rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a></h3>
<p>Rust Analyzer will provide the bulk of language support that we’ll need. It’ll give us auto complete, syntax
highlighting and symbol editing that will just make our lives a lot easier. Search for <code>rust-analyzer</code> in the search
bar at the top of the extensions tab and click install.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/images/vscode-extension-rust-analyzer.png" alt="vscode-extension-rust-analyzer.png" /></p>
<h3 id="codelldb"><a class="header" href="#codelldb">CodeLLDB</a></h3>
<p>As we learn any new language, one of the most important things for us to be able to do is see what’s actually happening.
CodeLLDB allows us to pause a program while its running and see what its doing. This lets us check that a program is
doing what we think its doing.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/images/vscode-extension-codelldb.png" alt="vscode-extension-codelldb.png" /></p>
<h3 id="even-better-toml"><a class="header" href="#even-better-toml">Even Better TOML</a></h3>
<p>The Rust ecosystem makes heavy use of the TOML file format. We’ll talk about this more much later on but now is a good
time to pick up this extension.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/images/vscode-extension-toml.png" alt="vscode-extension-toml.png" /></p>
<h3 id="crates"><a class="header" href="#crates">crates</a></h3>
<p>Rust developers share code through a mechanism called Crates. This extension will help us keep any crates we depend on
up to date. We won’t be using crates for a while, but it’s good to grab now. </p>
<p><img src="getting-started/images/vscode-extension-crates.png" alt="vscode-extension-crates.png" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hello-world"><a class="header" href="#hello-world">Hello World</a></h1>
<p>Now that we’re finally set up, lets create our first program. As is tradition, our first program is simply going to
print the words <code>Hello, world!</code>.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-rust-project"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-new-rust-project">Creating a new Rust project</a></h2>
<p>Open Visual Studio Code and open the terminal.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you’re new to Visual Studio Code and you want the editor to do something (say, for example, open a
terminal), hold <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Shift</code> and press <code>P</code> (or <code>Cmd</code> + <code>Shift</code> and press <code>P</code> on Mac). You can then type the thing
you want to do, and it should show up in the list. Sometimes, like with Terminal, you might get a lot of results and
the one you want might need a little scroll. Normally for a Terminal you want to use it internally, so you’d scroll to
<code>Terminal: Create New Terminal</code></p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/vscode-any-command-terminal.png" alt="Open the terminal" /></p>
<p>Navigate to an appropriate location for your projects such as your home directory or my documents, depending on your
system.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this on Mac and Linux is to do <code>cd ~</code></p>
<p>There isn’t really an equivalent on Windows, so if you aren’t sure you can instead use Explorer to open My Documents,
right-click an empty space in the window, click “More Options” then “Open in Terminal”</p>
<p>Run <code>cargo new hello-world</code>, and cargo will report that it has created the project</p>
<p>Cargo is the program we’ll use to run our rust programs as well as many of the rust tools that will help us along the
way.</p>
<p>Now in Visual Studio Code, go to File -&gt; Open Folder and navigate to the hello-world folder we just created.</p>
<p>You can see that cargo has created some files for us. We’re going to talk about the cargo files later but for now,
head into the <code>src</code> directory and open main.rs</p>
<p>You can see the file has already been created with the following code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Before we dive into this further, lets run the program.</p>
<p>Open the terminal again, as we did before. This time use <code>cargo run</code> to run our program, you should see something like
the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cargo run
   Compiling hello-world v0.1.0 (D:\Documents\hello-world)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33s
     Running `target\debug\hello-world.exe`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Well, that was easy 😅</p>
<p>You’ll find the Rust community has put a lot of effort into making Rust as easy as possible to learn and use.</p>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-hello-world"><a class="header" href="#anatomy-of-hello-world">Anatomy of Hello World</a></h2>
<p>Let’s talk about hello world.</p>
<p>The first line <code>fn main()</code> describes a function (fn) called main. Functions are a useful way to group up a bit of code
to be called elsewhere. We’ll talk more about the power of functions and when to use them in a future chapter. For now
all we need to know is that the main function is called when the program starts, so any code we put in here will run.</p>
<p>At the moment, the only line of code is <code>println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);</code>. A lot of engineers might assume this is how we
call functions in Rust, and that <code>println</code> is the function name. However, the exclamation mark actually tells us this
is a macro. Macros are very powerful and can do much more than functions, however they are an advanced topic, and we
won’t be creating our own until much later. We will be using pre-written macros a fair bit though.</p>
<p><code>println!</code> will write what it’s given to the console.</p>
<h2 id="running-and-debugging-rust"><a class="header" href="#running-and-debugging-rust">Running and Debugging Rust</a></h2>
<p>Before we end this section, I want to quickly set up one of the most powerful tools we have thats going to help us
learn incredibly quickly.</p>
<p>First let’s make a quick change to our program, by adding a variable with our name, and then saying hello to ourselves
instead of the whole world</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let name = &quot;Daniel&quot;;
    println!(&quot;Hello, {name}!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Fun fact, Rust uses utf-8 strings when written like this, so don’t worry if your name can not be properly represented in
American English characters. For example, I might naively write my cats name like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let name = &quot;ユキ&quot;;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>However, this won’t actually output correctly unless your system is set up to display it (thanks Windows).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hover the mouse over the <code>3</code> denoting line 3 (where the <code>println!</code> should be) you should see a little red dot  appear.
Click this dot to set a break point. When debugging code, the debugger will pause at break points allowing us to see
what’s actually happening.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/vscode-breakpoint.png" alt="Breakpoints" /></p>
<p>To debug our code press F5… and it will immediately show you an error. Don’t panic! This is where CodeLLDB is going
to do some magic for us. The error is because we didn’t set a default run configuration, click OK and Visual Studio Code
will ask if you want to generate one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Depending on your personal configuration, it may ask you want to create the configuration from. If you
are asked this, click <code>LLDB</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click “yes”, then press F5 again, and the program will start and then pause when it hits line 3.</p>
<p>If you mouse over <code>name</code> on either line 2 or line 3, you’ll see its value. Being able to see what’s happening in a
running program is a programming superpower.</p>
<p><img src="getting-started/./images/vscode-debug.png" alt="Breakpoints" /></p>
<p>To let the program continue, hit F5 one more time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="language-basics"><a class="header" href="#language-basics">Language Basics</a></h1>
<p>In this section we’re going to step through the language basics, attempting to cover enough to quickly move on to
language idioms. By doing this, we hope that people won’t end up with a lot of bad habits (like some of us did) as the
“easy” bits that help you get started end up overly ingrained in your memory.</p>

<h2 id="preamble"><a class="header" href="#preamble">Preamble</a></h2>
<p>The Rust programming language has a bit of a reputation: it’s hard to learn.</p>
<p>Certainly, when I learned Rust in 2017, I struggled with it.</p>
<p>But its 2024 now, I think things have changed.</p>
<p>I’m putting my time where my mouth is and making a series teaching Rust as quickly and, I hope, painlessly as possible.</p>
<p>This series has a free accompanying book, check the description below.</p>
<p>I’m Daniel, welcome to IRISS.</p>
<h2 id="why--why-not"><a class="header" href="#why--why-not">Why / Why Not</a></h2>
<p>We’re not going to jump into coding today though.</p>
<p>Sorry, in TTRPG terms, this is session zero.</p>
<p>I want to talk about why you should or should not learn Rust</p>
<p>what other learning resources are out there</p>
<p>and how this series is going to compare</p>
<h3 id="why-rust-1"><a class="header" href="#why-rust-1">Why Rust</a></h3>
<p>So why <em>should</em> you learn Rust?</p>
<p>I could tell you that:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s blazingly fast</li>
<li>It holds your hand and makes it hard to make mistakes</li>
<li>Its first party tooling is second to none</li>
<li>It has a mature ecosystem of tools and libraries</li>
<li>And it has an amazingly kind and supportive community</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these statements are true.</p>
<p>And all of these are great reasons to pick Rust up for your next personal or professional project.</p>
<p>But in my mind, there’s one reason everyone should consider trying out Rust:</p>
<p>Because its fun!</p>
<p>Seriously, Rust is my happy place.</p>
<p>Sure, like any language, it has its frustrations.</p>
<p>But when I work with Rust I <em>feel</em> smart</p>
<p>I have less horrible surprises than other languages I use professionally.</p>
<p>Amd I have a lot of confidence that my code will “just work”, that I won’t need to come back to fix bugs and if I do,
I’ll be able to quickly understand old code, write new tests and fix any problems.</p>
<p>And, I’m not alone, since its 1.0 release Rust has been Stack Overflows “most loved” language eight years in a row.</p>
<p>This isn’t just fanatics like me saying “its great” but is the percentage of people who used the language this year,
that still want to use it next year.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-rust-1"><a class="header" href="#why-not-rust-1">Why Not Rust</a></h3>
<p>Ok, but why <em>shouldn’t</em> you learn Rust.</p>
<p>As much as I love Rust, there is a reason it may not be the language for you… and it’s a <em>big</em> one.</p>
<p>If you are looking to learn a language to get a job (and you’re not specifically interested in Blockchain) Rust is not
going to be a good language… for now. </p>
<p>That said, things have been slowly changing.</p>
<p>More businesses are picking it up due to its low cost to write, run and maintain.</p>
<p>The biggest cost for businesses looking to adopt Rust is training people, but there are more and more of us out
there and perhaps 2024 will finally be the tipping point. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, right now, if you’re looking for a job, better languages to learn would be TypeScript or Python.</p>
<p>As well as being more marketable, these are genuinely great languages, and Rust will still be here when the time is
right for you.</p>
<h2 id="other-learning-resources-1"><a class="header" href="#other-learning-resources-1">Other Learning Resources</a></h2>
<p>My goal here is to get you into Rust, and if this series isn’t for you, or if you want to supplement IRISS with other
resources, these are, in my mind, the (other) best ways to learn Rust</p>
<h3 id="the-official-book-1"><a class="header" href="#the-official-book-1">The Official Book</a></h3>
<p>The Rust Programming Language book, also known as “the living book” is where I started seven years ago, but, it’s had
seven years of growth, and its amazing.</p>
<p>The main difference between the book and IRISS is that the book focuses on how the language works, while IRISS focuses
on how its written.</p>
<p>We will talk about how the language works but only in the context of why we write it the way that we do.</p>
<p>IRISS does, however, follow a similar path to both the official book and Rustlings (our next resource), so it should be
easy to jump between all three.</p>
<h3 id="rustlings-1"><a class="header" href="#rustlings-1">Rustlings</a></h3>
<p>Rustlings is a “learn by doing” guide to Rust. It works by giving you specific exercises to help you understand the
language a bit at a time.</p>
<p>The gamification of the course makes it really fun, and I still use Rustlings to help keep myself sharp.</p>
<p>There is also an IntelliJ Edu adaptation of Rustlings so if you install the free Community version of IntelliJ IDEA, you
can have an in editor tutorial.</p>
<h3 id="rust-by-example-1"><a class="header" href="#rust-by-example-1">Rust by Example</a></h3>
<p>Rust by Example does exactly what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>It focuses on the implementation of the Rust language.</p>
<p>This is great to quickly look things up if you know what you want to know, however, there’s some minor
pseudo-anti-patterns here that if you don’t already know are anti-patterns, you might accidentally copy.</p>
<p>Don’t worry though, we’ll cover these here but also tools like Clippy (which we’ll also cover) will be quick to point
them out.</p>
<h3 id="idiomatic-rust-in-simple-steps-2"><a class="header" href="#idiomatic-rust-in-simple-steps-2">Idiomatic Rust in Simple Steps</a></h3>
<p>So, why use IRISS if there are these other great resources?</p>
<p>Idiomatic Rust in Simple Steps lines up nicely with these other resources and can supplement them or vice versa. </p>
<p>While the other resources focus on simply learning the language, IRISS focuses on how and why we write the language the
way we do. </p>
<p>This might seem like the same thing, but here we’ll ramp up on idioms quickly so that you can understand other peoples
code as well as write code that other people can understand.</p>
<p>This matters!</p>
<p>My biggest hot take of the software industry is that: Software engineers are not paid to write code, we’re paid to
solve problems.</p>
<p>The best engineers I’ve worked with have solved problems without writing a single line of code, and the cheapest code to
maintain is the code you didn’t write. </p>
<p>Beyond this though, solving problems, even with code, takes understanding and collaboration. If when you join a team you
already understand why they write code the way they do, you’re going to become productive much faster.</p>

<p>This series has a free accompanying book, check the description below.</p>
<p>I’m Daniel, welcome to IRISS</p>
<h2 id="installing-rust"><a class="header" href="#installing-rust">Installing Rust</a></h2>
<p>First how do we install Rust</p>
<p>This depends on what operating system you’re using.</p>
<p>I’m going to go over Mac and Linux first as they’re both the same and quite simple.</p>
<p>Then I’ll cover Windows which is a little bit different.</p>
<p>Afterwards we’ll go over setting up our development which is roughly the same for all systems.</p>
<p>Use the video chapters to skip to the parts of the video that are appropriate for you.</p>
<h3 id="mac-and-linux-1"><a class="header" href="#mac-and-linux-1">Mac and Linux</a></h3>
<p>All we need to do is visit rustup dot rs</p>
<p>This is the official way to install Rust but I know a lot of people, rightly, worry about running things from the net in
their terminal, as you should when you install anything, so do whatever you need to feel confident about this.</p>
<p>Once you’re happy though, pop this in your console.</p>
<p>You’ll be asked if you want to customize the install, I’m not going to so I’ll choose 1 and press enter.</p>
<p>After a minute or two, the installation completes and you’ll see that it suggests sourcing the cargo env file.</p>
<p>You only need to do this if you want to use Rusts tools in the current terminal session, which we will, so we’ll do that</p>
<p>Now we can check that everything has installed correctly by running cargo version</p>
<p>And you should see something like this.</p>
<p>Thats it, we’re ready to go. Head on to the Development Environment chapter, unless you particularly want to watch 
a Windows user (me) suffer through that installation process.</p>
<h3 id="windows-1"><a class="header" href="#windows-1">Windows</a></h3>
<h4 id="build-tools"><a class="header" href="#build-tools">Build Tools</a></h4>
<p>Ok, installing Rust on Windows is little bit more challenging but you’ve got this, I believe in you.</p>
<p>First we’re going to need Microsoft build tools.</p>
<p>To get the build tools we’ll head to </p>
<p>visualstudio dot microsoft dot com slash downloads</p>
<p>and download the community edition</p>
<p>This installer is your gateway to a lot of stuff… almost none of which we actually need.</p>
<p>Click the tab for Individual components and search for the following</p>
<p>C++ x64 slash x86 build tools</p>
<p>Select the latest version</p>
<p>Next search for Windows SDK and choose the appropriate version for you.</p>
<p>I’m running Windows 11, so I’ll choose the latest version of that SDK.</p>
<p>Then we’ll click install and wait for it to do its thing. This can take a while so feel free to pause the video and
grab a cup of tea.</p>
<h4 id="rust-up"><a class="header" href="#rust-up">Rust up</a></h4>
<p>Now that we’ve got the build tools we can download the rust installer which we get from rustup dot rs</p>
<p>Download rustup-init.exe</p>
<p>When we run this we’re given the option to customize the installation. </p>
<p>I’m not going to do that so I’ll choose 1.</p>
<p>Once this is complete we can check that everything is working ok by opening a terminal (either cmd or powershell) and
running cargo version</p>
<p>We should see the currently installed version of Cargo</p>
<h4 id="gcc"><a class="header" href="#gcc">GCC</a></h4>
<p>Ok, there’s one more step that is… arguably optional and we (probably) won’t need it for this series but as soon as
you step outside the series, you’ll run into problems without it, so lets do it now.</p>
<p>This is a pain in the bum but I believe in you, you got this</p>
<p>You see Rust is a compiled language that can talk to and use other bits of compiled code</p>
<p>There are different ways to compile these languages and although at this point, you <em>can</em> compile anything we’re going
to build in this series, you won’t be able to compile everything that you could compile on Windows</p>
<p>For that we need GCC</p>
<p>The easiest way I’ve found to install GCC is via MSYS2</p>
<p>However, this… isn’t great. If anyone knows of an easier way to get it, please please comment below.</p>
<p>In the mean time, lets do this</p>
<p>First, we’re going to grab the installer from msys2 dot org </p>
<p>and then run that</p>
<p>MSYS2 is a little bit fussy about where you install it so if in doubt just pop it where it wants to be</p>
<p>I’m going to install mine to the D drive in programs slash msys2</p>
<p>Wherever you put it, keep its location in mind, we’ll have to find it again shortly</p>
<p>Once its installed, we need to make sure we have the ability to access any tools we install with it</p>
<p>We can do this by adding its binaries directory to the system path</p>
<p>First lets open the location where we installed it</p>
<p>Then open the ucrt64 directory, then bin</p>
<p>Copy the full address to the bin directory, you can do this by right clicking the address bar and clicking “Copy
Address”</p>
<p>Next we need to update the system path. Go to your start menu and search for “environment”, then click “Edit the system
environment variables”</p>
<p>This, weirdly, doesn’t take you straight to environment variables, but there is a button to do that at the bottom of
this screen.</p>
<p>Select Path, then hit edit</p>
<p>Click New on the right and paste in the address from earlier</p>
<p>Ok, last step</p>
<p>We’re going to run the application MSYS2 UCRT64</p>
<p>And we’ll run pacman dash capital S mingw w64 ucrt x86 64 gcc</p>
<p>You’ll be asked for confirmation, just hit enter</p>
<p>This will install gcc and all of its dependencies</p>
<p>Once finished we can check this worked with gcc –version</p>
<p>Phew, thats it, if you’re still here, you are incredible!</p>
<p>The first time I tried this I honestly nearly cried</p>
<p>If you haven’t done so already, its a good idea to restart your computer before moving on</p>
<p>Once you’re back we’ll set up a development environment</p>
<h2 id="the-development-environment-1"><a class="header" href="#the-development-environment-1">The Development Environment</a></h2>
<p>A software developers environment is something very specific to them. Some people love vim and neovim, others like Nova,
I’m personally a big fan of the IntelliJ ecosystem.</p>
<p>If you’ve already found the tools for you and they have good Rust support, there’s no wrong answer here, use whatever
makes you happy.</p>
<p>If you’re new to software engineering though, and not looking to fork out potentially hundreds on tooling, I recommend
Visual Studio Code. </p>
<p>It’s free, is perhaps the most widely used and supported editor today, and can be greatly extended through plugins.</p>
<p>It’s the editor I’ll be using throughout this series as I believe it will be the most familiar to people.</p>
<p>Lets go to code dot visualstudio dot com to download it</p>
<p>After installing it, we will need some plugins to work with Rust.</p>
<p>To get them, we’ll start the app</p>
<p>Then click the extension button in the side bar</p>
<p>So… what do we need?</p>
<h3 id="rust-analyzer-1"><a class="header" href="#rust-analyzer-1">rust-analyzer</a></h3>
<p>First and perhaps most obviously, we need language support. Rust Analyzer will give us syntax highlighting, auto
complete, symbol editing and will just generally make out lives a lot easier.</p>
<p>Lets grab that</p>
<h3 id="codelldb-1"><a class="header" href="#codelldb-1">CodeLLDB</a></h3>
<p>Next, lets give ourselves super powers.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can be working on code and its not doing what you expect</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be cool to just step over each line of code as it runs and see exactly whats happening</p>
<p>CodeLLDB will let us do that</p>
<p>We’ll cover how it works in a bit, for now lets just grab it</p>
<h3 id="even-better-toml-1"><a class="header" href="#even-better-toml-1">Even Better TOML</a></h3>
<p>The Rust ecosystem makes heavy use of the TOML file format</p>
<p>We’ll talk about this more much later on but now is a good time to pick up this extension</p>
<h3 id="crates-1"><a class="header" href="#crates-1">crates</a></h3>
<p>Finally, Rust developers share code through a mechanism called Crates</p>
<p>The crates extension will help us keep any crates we’re using up to date</p>
<p>Again, we’re not going to dive into this just yet but we should get it now while we’re here</p>
<h2 id="hello-world-1"><a class="header" href="#hello-world-1">Hello World</a></h2>
<p>With all of that out of the way, we are <em>finally</em> ready to create our first program</p>
<p>After all you’ve achieved already, you’re not going to believe how easy the next bit is</p>
<p>The first program most developers write in a new language is called Hello World</p>
<p>All it does is that when you run it, it will, in some way, output Hello World, so lets do that</p>
<p>Lets open up a terminal and navigate somewhere we want to work</p>
<p>So, for example, on Mac or Linux, I might make a directory in my home folder</p>
<p>On Windows I might navigate to My Documents and make a directory there</p>
<p>Now we’ll use cargo, remember cargo, from what seems like forever ago, to make our new project</p>
<p>cargo new hello hyphen world</p>
<p>We’ll CD into that project and open it in code by typing code dot</p>
<p>As you can see, cargo has created a few files for us</p>
<p>A .gitignore file which is useful for version control</p>
<p>Version Control Systems are out of scope of this series but I highly recommend looking into a system called Git</p>
<p>This will let you save your work in incremental steps as well as being an industry standard method of sharing and
collaboration</p>
<p>Cargo.toml describes the project as a whole, what dependencies it uses and any special preparations or settings it needs</p>
<p>We’ll come back to this file in the future but for now we won’t be using it</p>
<p>Finally we have our source directory in which all of our Rust code will live</p>
<p>The name of the file main.rs is used to tell Rust that we’re going to make an executable program</p>
<p>Inside we’ll see we can already see some code</p>
<p>Before I go through it all, lets run the program</p>
<p>For now we can do this from the terminal which we can do inside Code</p>
<p>Pro Tip for new Visual Studio Code users, if you want to do something and aren’t sure how, you can hold Control (or 
Command on Macs) Shift and hit P</p>
<p>This brings up a little search bar you can use to find what you want in this case a terminal</p>
<p>Sometimes you might have to scroll a little to find the exact right thing but recently used things will filter to the
top so we don’t have to do this too often</p>
<p>The terminal should open in our projects directory so all we have to do now is type cargo run</p>
<p>We get some output that its compiled and then we get our Hello World written to the screen!</p>
<p>Well that was easy. Our first rust program which we’ve arguably built ourselves without writing a single line of code
manually</p>
<p>You’ll find that the Rust community has put a lot of effort into making Rust as easy as possible to learn an use</p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-hello-world-1"><a class="header" href="#anatomy-of-hello-world-1">Anatomy of Hello World</a></h3>
<p>Looking out our main.rs lets break it down line by line</p>
<p>First we have this <code>fn main() {</code></p>
<p>In Rust, fn is how we describe a function</p>
<p>We can usually call functions anything we like but when we create an executable program, we need a function called
“main” to be the start point</p>
<p>The parenthesis after the name of the function is where we normally put parameters</p>
<p>Parameters are how we pass data into a function, but we don’t pass data into the main function so this is empty</p>
<p>The curly bracket that opens on this line has a matching closing curly bracket, everything inside is part of the
function</p>
<p>Inside the function we have one line but lets break it into parts</p>
<p>First, the println (or print line) with an exclamation mark might look a bit like another function however, when you see
a label like print line followed by an exclamation mark its actually something called a macro.</p>
<p>Creating macros is a very advanced topic and we won’t cover that until near the end of this series, however, they are
incredibly powerful and we will be using them a lot.</p>
<p>For now, don’t worry about it, all you need to know is that they can do a lot more than functions and often don’t
behave anything like functions</p>
<p>We still have parentheses delimiting the start and end of what we’re passing to the macro, but in this case you <em>could</em>
also use square brackets or curly brackets, but for print line parentheses are the convention</p>
<h2 id="running-and-debugging"><a class="header" href="#running-and-debugging">Running and Debugging</a></h2>
<p>Before we end this video, I believe I promised you all some super powers</p>
<p>First lets make a quick change</p>
<p>Lets add our name into a variable.</p>
<p>I’ll be talking more about variables in a couple of videos time, but quickly, we declare a variable with let, give it a
name put an equals sign after and then the value</p>
<p>String values like this need to be delimited with double quotes in Rust</p>
<p>Quite nicely this reads as let name equal Daniel</p>
<p>Another quick note: if your name does not use American English characters, this type of string in Rust is UTF-8 by
default and your name should be fine, however, your operating system might not be so when it writes it our, your milage
may vary. </p>
<p>My Mac is fine with my cats name, Yuki, but Windows, not so much</p>
<p>Anyway, we’re going to modify our print line now to include the variable</p>
<p>There are a number of ways we can achieve this but the idiomatic way to do this is to use curly brackets and put the
variable name inside</p>
<p>Before we run our program again, if you mouse over the line number on line 3, you should see a little red dot appear,
click it</p>
<p>This is whats called a break point</p>
<p>Next we’re going to run our program inside Code by pressing F5 and… uh oh… error message</p>
<p>Don’t panic, this is just because we didn’t tell Code how to run the program, luckily it can work it out for us</p>
<p>This varies a little bit on Mac and Windows but we’re just going to tell it to run the program with LLDB</p>
<p>Now when we press F5 again, the program compiles and starts running but look! It stopped at the break point</p>
<p>We can now hover over the variable and see not only whats inside but how its stored</p>
<p>Having the ability to do this is incredible when trying to debug things or understand how something works</p>
<h2 id="next-time"><a class="header" href="#next-time">Next Time</a></h2>
<p>And that’s it for today! It was a longer one today but honestly, just getting started might be the hardest part of the
whole series, but you did it and that’s awesome, I’m legitimately proud of you</p>
<p>Next time we’re going to make a slightly more advanced program by taking a bit of input and doing some comparisons</p>
<p>This way we can get a feel for how Rust looks and feels.</p>
<p>We won’t dig too deeply into the hows and whys yet we’ll have some more depth in the video after</p>
<p>If thats interesting to you, don’t forget to like and subscribe</p>
<p>In the meantime, seriously, well done, take some time to reflect on your achievement, </p>
<p>You’re now an official Rustacean </p>
<p>And I’ll see you next time!</p>
