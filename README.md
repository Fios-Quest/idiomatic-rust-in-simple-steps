# Idiomatic Rust In Simple Steps

Welcome to IRISS 👁️🦀

Rust has a reputation of being difficult to learn, certainly it was when I learned back in 2017. While its true that
there remain some rough edges, the language is now easier to pick up than ever, and in many ways is much easier than
a lot of more established languages.

The goal of this series is to help you go from no knowledge of Rust to understanding how Rust is written as quickly as
possible.

This repository will provide the content in book form, however, the plan is to make a full YouTube series.
