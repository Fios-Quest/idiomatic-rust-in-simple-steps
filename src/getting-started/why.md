Why or Why Not
==============

1. [Why should you consider Rust](#why-rust)
2. [Why not Rust](#why-not-rust)


Why Rust
--------

I could tell you that it's a "blazingly fast" language, that holds your hand and helps reduce bugs, that its first party
tooling is second to none, that it has a mature ecosystem and an amazing community. These are all good reasons to
consider using Rust for any personal or professional project. There is, however, in my mind, a singular reason everyone
should consider learning Rust:

**Because its fun**

Seriously, Rust is my happy place. Sure it has its frustrations like any language, but when I work with Rust I _feel_
smart, I have less horrible surprises, and I have a lot of confidence that my code will "just work", that I won't need
to come back to fix bugs and if I do, I will be able to quickly understand old code, write new tests and fix any
problems.

And, I'm not alone, since its 1.0 release Rust has been Stack Overflows "most loved" (now "most admired") language eight
years in a row. This isn't derived from fanatics like me just saying "its great" but is the percentage of people who
used the language this year, that still want to use it next year.

Why not Rust
------------

As much as I love Rust, there is a reason it may not be the language for you... and it's a _big_ one.

If you are specifically looking to learn a language to get a job (and you're not interested in Blockchain) Rust is not
going to be a good language... for now. The irony of "professional Rust" is that Rust engineers think there are no Rust
employers, and Rust employers think there are no Rust engineers _because_ very few of us are interested in Blockchain
technologies.

That said, things have been slowly changing. More businesses are picking it up due to its low cost to write, run and
maintain. The main cost to adopting Rust remains the cost of training people, but there are more and more of us out
there and perhaps 2024 will finally be the tipping point. 

Nonetheless, right now, if you're looking for a job,
[better languages to learn](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-language-prof) would be
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) or [Python](https://www.python.org).
