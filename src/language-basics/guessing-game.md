# Guessing Game

We're going to start in the same place as the official Rust book,
[with a guessing game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)! However, we're going to
do things a little bit differently.

We'll start as we did with Hello World, and create a new project with cargo

```shell
$ cargo new guessing-game
```

Opening `src/main.rs` we#ll see the same code as before:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
