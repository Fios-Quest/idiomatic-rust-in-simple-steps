Unsafe Rust
===========

Arguably, the main reason you'd want to pick up Rust over any other low-level language is that Rust keeps you safe.

When you write a program in a compiled language like Rust, C, C++, Zig, it's converted into instructions for processors 
(CPUs, GPUs). These instructions are very direct, move the data in this register to this other register, add, subtract,
or multiply (but, fun fact, sometimes not divide). There are no restrictions on what those low-level instructions can 
do, which means you can do things that might not be considered safe. For example, allow two threads to read and write to
the same register at the same time.

Using high-level languages allows us to abstract this behavior in ways that are easier for us to understand. These
languages can go further than just making the instructions easier to read and write, they can also enforce their own
rules as to how they're used.

The reason that Rust has ownership rules and borrow checkers is to make sure that we, the software engineers, don't ask
the processor to do anything that _could_ be unsafe. To the best of its ability, Rust will check that your code is safe,
but, if it _only_ let you do things _it_ could prove are safe, you'd be cut off from making a lot of programs. 

Sometimes when we use Rust, we need to access heap memory, use peripherals, and talk to other software, or even dip into
those specific processor instructions we just mentioned. We can't guarantee that any of these actions are safe.

But wait! Haven't we _been_ accessing Heap Memory throughout this book? Yes, we have. Types like `Vec` and `String`
use the Heap to store their data. They take responsibility for, and abstract away, any unsafe work, meaning that _using_
`Vec`, `String` and similar types _is_ considered safe.

As a Rust engineer, depending on the type of project you're working on, most of the time you won't personally need to
worry about unsafe Rust. You can get by with using other people's APIs like the standard library. The point of this
chapter isn't to prepare you to write lots of unsafe Rust; it's to make you feel comfortable for the odd occasion you
might have to touch it.

Recap on Memory
---------------

Typically, when we talk about memory in programming, we're talking about RAM, but even then we subdivide memory into
three main types of usages, each of which has different pros and cons.

Stack Memory is where all variables live. It's fast because the entire stack is pre-allocated when your program runs,
but there are some catches. 

First, it's actually quite limited. When your program starts, it's given an amount of memory that you cannot determine
ahead of time, and you cannot change. It's _usually_ 2MiB, but you might find It's less on targets like embedded
devices. If you use more than this small amount of memory, your program will crash.

Second, stack data must be of known size at compile time. You don't really need to worry about why this is only that
data on the stack cannot change in size.

But wait! We've stored lots of things in variables that have variable size; `String`s, `Vec`s, `HashMaps`, etc. The data 
for these types is not stored in the variable. What typically happens is that data is stored on the Heap, and the data's
location, and some other metadata, which is of known size, is stored on the stack.

Semantically, it's probably fine to say that the variable contains that data; people will always know what you mean.
However, for this chapter, we really need to differentiate what is on the stack and what isn't.

In the below code, `number_example` stores the actual number on the stack, since its of a known size, 32 bits unless
otherwise specified. `string_example`, however, contains the location of the string data, not the data itself, which is
stored on the heap. (We'll talk about how it gets to the heap shortly).

```rust
fn main() {
    let number_example = 42;
    let string_example = String::from("This is string data too");
}
```

The Heap is where we can store things of arbitrary size, and we can (usually) store things far larger than the stack.
Heap memory is allocated on request and freed once you're done using it. Technically, we can't resize heap allocations,
but we can request new, larger portions of heap memory, copy our data there, free the old memory, and add more things in
the new location until we run out of space again.

So it's bigger and more flexible than the stack, but it also has some downsides. It's much slower than stack memory
because allocating and freeing the memory takes time. Allocation and Freeing in Rust is usually handled by the standard
library and, other than what we're going to discuss in this chapter, you almost never need to think about that process,
but it's not free.

> Note: Once heap memory is allocated, it's _almost_ free to use, with the only overhead essentially being the
> redirection from the stack to the heap in O(1) time. For this reason, some software will actually allocate large 
> amounts of memory called Page Files that can store lots of different things. This can be done in Rust too, and there
> are pros and cons to this too, but it's far outside the scope of this guide.

There's a third kind of memory we don't really talk about as much, but it might be the most important.

Static Memory is where all values and data you write into your program are initially stored, though frequently it's 
subsequently moved somewhere else. For example, in the program:

```rust
const CONST_EXAMPLE: &str = "This is string data";

fn main() {
    let number_example = 42;
    let string_example = String::from("This is string data too");
}
```

The data for `CONST_EXAMPLE` remains in static memory, but similar to variables that contain heap data locations,
`CONST_EXAMPLE` itself is a reference to that data (note the`&`). `42` and `"This is string data too"` are also
initially stored in static data, however, `42` is copied to the stack in `number_example` whereas 
`"This is string data too"` is cloned onto the heap and the location of the data is stored in `string_example`.

Differentiating where things are stored is about to become _very_ important, and it's easy to make mistakes if we don't
differentiate between the stack, the heap and static memory. (Thank-you [@ChillFish8](https://github.com/ChillFish8)
for helping me out when I made that exact mistake writing this chapter 😉)

Not really all that unsafe
--------------------------

It's important to note that Unsafe Rust doesn't turn _off_ any of Rusts safety measures, what it does do is turn _on_ a
whole other set of language features on which Rusts usual safety tools cannot work.

I really can't stress this enough as it might be one of the greatest misconceptions in Rust. Unsafe Rust does _not_
turn off _any_ safety measures. It turns on tools that Rust cannot guarantee are safe, so you need to make extra
certain you are using them safely.

For example, in safe Rust we use references. These are similar to pointers in other languages which point to a location
in memory, but they are not pointers. The validity of pointers is not checked, but in Rust, reference abides by rules 
that guarantee they are valid. References in unsafe Rust must still abide by the rules of the borrow checker. Unsafe 
Rust doesn't turn off the borrow checker, instead it gives us access to raw pointers which can't be borrow checked.

Some of these tools exist in other commonly used low-level languages that have been around for decades and are still,
rightly, very popular today. In these languages, these tools are available at any time. Having the tools is not a bad
thing. They're necessary tools that we need to do things that there is no other way to do.

Raw Pointers
------------

One of the main reasons you might want to dip into unsafe Rust is to communicate with memory on its terms. Rust's
abstractions around memory are powerful, usually free (or otherwise cheap) and very flexible, but they don't cover
everything. You may have a use case where you need to talk to memory directly without going through Rust's abstractions
and Rust lets you do that by turning on its unsafe features to access raw pointers.

We use References in Rust a bit like other languages use pointers to point to something that's actually stored 
elsewhere. But references have a number of features that make them safer to use. A pointer is essentially just a number
that is an address to a location in memory. When you allocate heap data, even in Rust, the operating system amongst
other things provides you with a pointer to the location where the memory was allocated.

If we just used a pointer, it would still contain an address to that location even if we subsequently told the
operating system to free that memory. Programmatically, we have no way to know if that location is still ours to use
later. Using that pointer after the memory would be an error, and is the root of an extremely common bug you might have
heard of, use after free.

In fact, because we don't know from just the pointer whether the memory was freed or not, we might even try to free the
memory again, leading to another bug "double free".

References help us avoid that because we can track their use at compile time, helping us make sure that they are always
valid before we even run the code... but the operating system doesn't use references. Actually, references can't be used
between _any_ two separate pieces of software, because of the compile time nature of them. We can, however, share 
pointer locations.

So, even in Rust, pointers are being used all the time, whether we see them or not. Sometimes, as software engineers, we 
may even need to use pointers directly ourselves.

You can actually get pointers in safe Rust. Try running this program multiple times, you should get a different number
every time:

```rust
# fn main() {
let the_answer = 42;
let pointer = &raw const the_answer;

println!("The variable at {pointer:p} contains the data '{the_answer}'");
# }
```

One cool thing worth pointing out is that Rust even types your pointers, making it harder to muddle them up later. A 
pointer to an `i32` has the type `*const i32`

```rust
# use std::any::type_name;
# 
# // Thanks to @DevinR528 https://github.com/DevinR528
# // Source: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/how-check-type-of-variable/33845/2
# fn type_of<T>(_: T) -> &'static str {
#     type_name::<T>()
# }
# 
# fn main() {
let the_answer = 42;
let pointer = &raw const the_answer;
    
assert_eq!(type_of(pointer), "*const i32");
println!("{}", type_of(pointer));
# }
```

Remember, in some circumstances, the variable that you're accessing the data via does not contain the actual data.
Strings are a good example of this. The pointer to the variable does not point to the data, it points to metadata which
itself contains a pointer to the data. We can access the pointer to the data via a method on the string itself (this is
inherited from string slices). Again, there's nothing unsafe about doing this.

```rust
# fn main() {
let hello = String::from("Hello, world!");
let pointer_to_variable = &raw const hello;
let pointer_to_data = hello.as_ptr();
    
println!(
    "The variable at {pointer_to_variable:p}, \
    points to {pointer_to_data:p} \
    which contains the data '{hello}'",
);
# }
```

Getting pointers is perfectly safe. What we can't do is use those pointers to get data in safe Rust. For that we need to
dip into unsafe. Below we dereference the pointer to go back from the location to the data that's stored there.

```rust
# fn main() {
let the_answer = 42;
let pointer = &raw const the_answer;

// SAFETY: We own `the_answer` which in scope and is not being used elsewhere
unsafe {
    let data_at_pointer = *pointer;
    assert_eq!(data_at_pointer, 42);
}
# }
```

This is unsafe because the validity of the pointer cannot be confirmed. `pointer` could outlive `the_answer`, after 
which, what is `pointer` pointing at? It is still pointing at the same memory location, but something else might have
already started using that location.

Unsafe functions
----------------

When we write code, we regularly break it up into small reusable chunks known as functions. You are, at this point, I
hope, very familiar with this idea.

So far we've demonstrated that we can place unsafe code inside a block to encapsulate unsafe behavior. This means that
you can write unsafe code inside a function, as long as you write the function to make sure that there's no risk,
meaning, for someone calling the function, it _is_ safe.

A good example of this is the [`std::mem::swap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.swap.html) which swaps the values
at two mutable locations:

```rust
# fn main() {
let mut left = "Left".to_string();
let mut right = "Right".to_string();

println!("Left is {left}");
println!("Right is {right}");

std::mem::swap(&mut left, &mut right);
    
assert_eq!(left, "Right".to_string());
assert_eq!(right, "Left".to_string());

println!("Left is {left}");
println!("Right is {right}");
# }
```

Because `swap` guarantees the types are the same and, through using mutable references, knows nothing else is accessing
the memory while it does its thing, conceptually this function is safe, even if the first thing it does internally is
run unsafe code. This is what we call a safe abstraction around unsafe code.

But that's not always possible. Sometimes, the very concept a function or method represents is unsafe.

Let's say that through arbitrary means, we've got a pointer to some heap data that we know represents a String. We know
how long the String is and how much memory at that location is ours. We want to take ownership of that memory and turn
it into a `String` type.

We can use the `from_raw_parts` on the `String` type to build a `String` directly from memory, but the entire concept
of manually creating a string like this is unsafe.

Firstly, something else likely manages that Heap memory. If we create a `String` from it, we're going to take joint
ownership of the heap data, and when our String goes out of scope, Rust will try to free it. How do we prevent a double 
free when the thing that originally created the data also wants to free it?

Secondly, `from_raw_parts` takes a pointer, a length, and a capacity, none of which can be validated at compile time.

Remember, length and capacity of collections including `String` are different. Length is how much data is being stored
currently. Capacity is how much memory is available to contain potential data. Most types will cause a reallocation when
the capacity is filled, causing us another problem to look out for!

Luckily, by being aware of the problems ahead of time, we can still use this function safely.

```rust
# use std::ops::Deref;
# 
# fn main() {
// We'll manually make sure our string never exceeds 100 bytes
// Note: The string _may_ be created with more than 100 bytes, we will own the
// entire _actual_ capacity and need to free it all.
let capacity = 100;

let mut original_string = String::with_capacity(capacity);
// 57 ascii chars = 57 bytes
original_string.push_str("This string is a longer string but less than the capacity");

let pointer = original_string.as_mut_ptr();

// SAFETY: We create a string from the original, but we prevent the new string
// from being moved by staying inside its capacity, and we prevent it being
// dropped by using ManuallyDrop.
unsafe {
    // `from_raw_parts` is an `unsafe` method so can only be called inside an
    // unsafe block
    let overlapping_string = String::from_raw_parts(pointer, 15, capacity);

    // Before we do anything else, we're going to prevent `overlapping_string` 
    // from being dropped, which would otherwise cause a double free when 
    // `original_string` is dropped later. We could equally prevent 
    // `original_string` being dropped instead, but, to me, it makes sense to
    // have this behavior in the inner code block. This also means if the
    // capacity of `original_string` was larger than `capacity` it won't cause
    // unfreed memory.
    // 
    // The ManuallyDrop type is actually safe. Although it prevents the memory
    // being freed, and _could_ result in memory leaks that's not considered
    // unsafe in the same way as other things in this chapter. Just be careful
    // using it.
    let mut overlapping_string = std::mem::ManuallyDrop::new(overlapping_string);

    // Confirm we have the right location!
    assert_eq!(overlapping_string.deref(), &"This string is ".to_string());
    
    // Push some data onto the back of the string
    overlapping_string.push_str("short");
    
    assert_eq!(overlapping_string.deref(), &"This string is short".to_string());
}

// Un oh!
assert_eq!(original_string, "This string is shortger string but less than the capacity");
# }
```

It's not unusual to create an unsafe function (because conceptually what you're doing is unsafe, like creating a string
directly from memory), but then wrap that function in safe code. For example, the internal representation of data inside
the String is a slice, which also has the method `from_raw_parts` (though it works slightly differently as slices don't
have capacity, just length). `slice::from_raw_parts_mut` is unsafe, but it's used inside the safe method
`String::retain`.

Creating safe abstractions might look something like this:

```rust
/// # SAFETY
/// 
/// To use this safely you... don't need to do anything because this function
/// just returns true
unsafe fn conceptually_dangerous_function() -> bool {
    true
}

fn safe_abstraction() -> bool {
    // Do some checks
    
    // SAFETY: We confirmed safety by doing the following checks
    // - again, the function does nothing so nothing to really check here
    unsafe {
        conceptually_dangerous_function()
    }
}

# fn main() {
// We can safely call the safe abstraction to do unsafe things safely
let output = safe_abstraction();
assert!(output);
# }
```

When it comes to traits, if any of its methods are unsafe, then the entire trait is considered unsafe, and so is its
implementation. It's actually kind of rare to _have_ to use this feature. If your trait has an unsafe method but a safe
abstraction, you could move the unsafe method to an unsafe function.

For example, this trait has two provided methods, but we still can't implement it safely, even with the default
implementations. 

```rust,compile_fail
unsafe trait NotSafe {
    /// # Safety
    ///
    /// This method isn't actually unsafe
    unsafe fn conceptually_dangerous_method(&self) -> bool {
        true
    }
    
    fn safe_abstraction(&self) -> bool {
        // SAFETY: The method called isn't actually unsafe
        unsafe {
            self.conceptually_dangerous_method()
        }
    }
}

struct ExampleUnitType;

impl NotSafe for ExampleUnitType {}
```

We can implement it with the unsafe keyword though:

```rust
unsafe trait NotSafe {
    // ...snip...
#     /// # Safety
#     ///
#     /// This method isn't actually unsafe
#     unsafe fn conceptually_dangerous_method(&self) -> bool {
#         true
#     }
#     
#     fn safe_abstraction(&self) -> bool {
#         // SAFETY: The method called isn't actually unsafe
#         unsafe {
#             self.conceptually_dangerous_method()
#         }
#     }
}

struct ExampleUnitType;

unsafe impl NotSafe for ExampleUnitType {}
```

However, if we don't need to ever override the unsafe method, we could just extract it from the trait entirely

```rust
/// # Safety 
/// 
/// This method isn't actually unsafe
unsafe fn conceptually_dangerous_method<T: Safer + ?Sized>(w: &T) -> bool {
    true
}

trait Safer {
    fn safe_abstraction(&self) -> bool {
        // # Safety The method called isn't actually unsafe
        unsafe {
            conceptually_dangerous_method(self)
        }
    }
}

struct ExampleUnitType;

impl Safer for ExampleUnitType {}
```

You're likely to need unsafe Traits only when the behavior the trait describes is itself is unsafe. For example, `Send`
and `Sync` are automatically applied to all types that are only constructed from types that are also `Send` and `Sync`.
If your type contains types that are not `Send` and/or `Sync` then the compiler can no longer guarantee safety itself.
You can still implement `Send` and `Sync` for your type manually but its now up to you to check the implementation is
safe, so the traits themselves are `unsafe`.

Unions
------

Unions, in software engineering, are a way of storing different types in the same section of memory. They're typically 
broken into two flavors, tagged and untagged. "Tagged" simply means the type is part of data, so you can only access the
data _as_ the type that it is. We use tagged unions in Rust all the time, and they're perfectly safe:

```rust
enum ThisIsATaggedUnion {
    Number(u64),
    Character(char),
}
```

Enums are tagged unions, they only ever take up as much memory as is taken by the largest data type representable inside
them, plus a discrimination value which differentiates the variants at runtime (usually represented as an `isize` but
Rust compilers _may_ use smaller numeric types):

```rust
enum ThisIsATaggedUnion {
    Number(u64),
    Character(char),
}

# fn main() {
let number = ThisIsATaggedUnion::Number(42);
let character = ThisIsATaggedUnion::Character('c');

assert_eq!(size_of_val(&number), size_of_val(&character));
assert_ne!(size_of_val(&'c'), size_of_val(&character));

println!("Size of character: {} bytes", size_of_val(&'c'));
println!("Size of u64: {} bytes", size_of_val(&42_u64));

let discriminant = std::mem::discriminant(&number);
println!("Size of enum discriminant: {} bytes", size_of_val(&discriminant));

println!("Size of enum number: {} bytes", size_of_val(&number));
println!("Size of enum character: {} bytes", size_of_val(&character));
# }
```

But Rust also has "untagged" unions, where the type being used is not part of the data, and you can access the data as
any listed type. Untagged unions are obviously unsafe, but they provide several useful features, either by allowing you
to interrogate the data in different ways, or for working with other programming languages that use untagged unions.

> Note: My first attempt at an example for unions was an IPv4 address that used both a 32bit integer, _and_ a four byte
> array, however, with that example we have to consider "endianness" which is the order in which bytes are stored in
> memory. This felt like it went too far off-topic, however, it's still worth pointing out that when creating unions

In this example, we can interrogate characters as u32's (characters in Rust are four bytes, although most string types
use a variable byte width encoding such as utf-8).

```rust
union CharOrNumber {
    number: u32,
    character: char,
}

# fn main() {
// Creating unions is safe:
let mut h = CharOrNumber { character: 'O' };

// Reading unions is an unsafe operation. Even in this case where both u32 and 
// char are 32 bits wide, not all valid i32 values are valid chars, but all
// chars are valid i32s
    
// SAFETY: We only set the character variant meaning both variants are valid.
unsafe {
    println!("The numeric value of the character {} is 0x{:x}", h.character, h.number)
}

// Writing values is safe, 
h.character = 'o';

// See how both character and number change

// SAFETY: We only set the character variant meaning both variants are valid.
unsafe {
    println!("The numeric value of the character {} is 0x{:x}", h.character, h.number)
}
# }
```

Assembly
--------

This next example of unsafe is so incredibly unsafe the only time you're ever likely to use it is if you need insane
speed and know _exactly_ what you're doing with the _exact_ hardware you're targeting.

You might have heard of assembly, but crucially, it's not one language. Assembly languages are languages that have a near
1:1 relationship with the actual instructions of the CPU you're building for.

In the below example you can see a function that takes a number and multiplies it by 6 using assembly. There are two
versions of the function, one that works using the "x86_64" (most Windows and Linux machines and older Macs) and another
that works using "aarch64" (all modern Macs but also some newer Windows and Linux machines). As you can see, apart from
`mov`, the other instructions look very different but do the same things.

```rust
use std::arch::asm;

#[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")]
fn multiply_by_six(input: u64) -> u64 {
    let mut x = input;
    unsafe  {
        asm!(
            "mov {tmp}, {x}",
            "shl {tmp}, 1",
            "shl {x}, 2",
            "add {x}, {tmp}",
            x = inout(reg) x,
            tmp = out(reg) _,
        );
    }
    x
}

#[cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")]
fn multiply_by_six(input: u64) -> u64 {
    let mut x = input;
    unsafe  {
        asm!(
            "mov {tmp}, {x}",
            "lsl {tmp}, {tmp}, #1",
            "lsl {x}, {x}, #2",
            "add {x}, {x}, {tmp}",
            x = inout(reg) x,
            tmp = out(reg) _,
        );
    }
    x
}

# fn main() {
let four_times_six = multiply_by_six(4);
assert_eq!(four_times_six, 24);
println!("4 * 6 is {}", four_times_six);
# }
```

For obvious reasons, Rust cannot help keep you safe when you're sending instructions straight to the CPU (or any
hardware for that matter, but we're not covering that here), so assembly is only available within unsafe code. Of all
Rust's unsafe features, this is the one you're least likely to need to touch, but, as with the others, it's there if you
need it.

extern
------

A lot of the time you're going to be working with other peoples code. Most often, that code will be written in Rust,
downloaded as a crate, and combined with your code into a single binary. Sometimes, though, you'll want to work with
code written in other languages, either by consuming a library written in another language, or by building a library
that another language can consume.

This is done with `extern`.

For compiled languages to interoperate, they need to use an Application Binary Interface. Rust doesn't (and probably
never will) have a stable ABI. Instead, we use typically use C's, though
[other options also exist](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/external-blocks.html#abi). 

Creating a library that can be consumed by other languages is fairly safe. You define a function that will be made
available externally (thus the name). The function itself is safe... exposing it is not. To be made available, the name
of the function has to be known.

Rust "mangles" its function names to make sure that there are never any collisions. To expose the function, we need to
know its name, so we need to prevent the mangling, but that means there's a risk of collision. Pre Rust-2024 preventing
mangling was done with the `#[no_mangle]` attribute, but as of Rust 2024, we need to explicitly tell Rust that we
understand the dangers.

```rust
// SAFETY: No other global function will use this name, this does not need to
// be part of the documentation though.
#[unsafe(no_mangle)]
pub extern "C" fn exported_function(input: i32) -> bool {
    println!("Function called from another program with the value {input}");
    true
}
```

There's one more thing to consider, though. Our code will be called by code that we can't control. You probably want to
make sure you validate data coming from eternal code, especially for anything more complex than a number.

You can also call functions from other libraries if they use a supported ABI too. You do this by linking an extern block
to a specific library and then listing the signatures of the functions exposed by that library that you want to use in
your code.

Everything about this is unsafe. If there's no dynamic library on the target system that shares a name with the linked
library, the program will panic. If the function names do not match, the program will panic. If the function names match
but the signature doesn't, you'll get undefined behavior. 

```rust,compile_fail
# struct SomeErrorType;
# 
// SAFETY: The listed function signatures match those exposed in
// the some_external_library header files.
#[link(name = "some_external_library")]
unsafe extern "C" {

Summary
-------

Outside of specialist use cases, you're unlikely to have to write much, if any, unsafe code yourself. Nonetheless,
hopefully after this chapter you see that it's not as scary as it seems. You still have all the normal safety checks
plus some additional features, and now you know what to look for to keep yourself safe when the compiler can no longer
help.

If you are going to be writing unsafe Rust, there's a tool called [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) that will,
in your running code, help you detect potentially undefined behavior you might have missed. It's not a panacea but is a
final layer of protection you should use to protect yourself.

Next Chapter
------------

We're going to lean into pretty much everything we've learned so far to learn async Rust. This is going to be a bit of
a unique chapter. We'll go deeper than you generally need to go in our exploration of the space (typically you would
grab a crate to do all the hard stuff). But by learning the core concepts, you should come out the other side with a
much better idea of how async works under the hood. As with this chapter, while you won't need to know everything, it
should help you feel comfortable with what I think many would agree is the last remaining truly sharp edge of Rust
programming.
