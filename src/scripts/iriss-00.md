IRISS 00 - Welcome to IRISS
===========================


Preamble
--------

The Rust programming language has a bit of a reputation: it's hard to learn.

Certainly, when I learned Rust in 2017, I struggled with it.

But its 2024 now, I think things have changed.

I'm putting my time where my mouth is and making a series teaching Rust as quickly and, I hope, painlessly as possible.

This series has a free accompanying book, check the description below.

I'm Daniel, welcome to IRISS.


Why / Why Not
-------------

We're not going to jump into coding today though.

Sorry, in TTRPG terms, this is session zero.

I want to talk about why you should or should not learn Rust

what other learning resources are out there

and how this series is going to compare


### Why Rust

So why _should_ you learn Rust?

I could tell you that:
- It's blazingly fast
- It holds your hand and makes it hard to make mistakes
- Its first party tooling is second to none
- It has a mature ecosystem of tools and libraries
- And it has an amazingly kind and supportive community

All of these statements are true.

And all of these are great reasons to pick Rust up for your next personal or professional project.

But in my mind, there's one reason everyone should consider trying out Rust:

Because its fun!

Seriously, Rust is my happy place.

Sure, like any language, it has its frustrations.

But when I work with Rust I _feel_ smart

I have less horrible surprises than other languages I use professionally.

Amd I have a lot of confidence that my code will "just work", that I won't need to come back to fix bugs and if I do,
I'll be able to quickly understand old code, write new tests and fix any problems.

And, I'm not alone, since its 1.0 release Rust has been Stack Overflows "most loved" language eight years in a row.

This isn't just fanatics like me saying "its great" but is the percentage of people who used the language this year,
that still want to use it next year.


### Why Not Rust

Ok, but why _shouldn't_ you learn Rust.

As much as I love Rust, there is a reason it may not be the language for you... and it's a _big_ one.

If you are looking to learn a language to get a job (and you're not specifically interested in Blockchain) Rust is not
going to be a good language... for now. 

That said, things have been slowly changing.

More businesses are picking it up due to its low cost to write, run and maintain.

The biggest cost for businesses looking to adopt Rust is training people, but there are more and more of us out
there and perhaps 2024 will finally be the tipping point. 

Nonetheless, right now, if you're looking for a job, better languages to learn would be TypeScript or Python.

As well as being more marketable, these are genuinely great languages, and Rust will still be here when the time is
right for you.


Other Learning Resources
------------------------

My goal here is to get you into Rust, and if this series isn't for you, or if you want to supplement IRISS with other
resources, these are, in my mind, the (other) best ways to learn Rust

### The Official Book

The Rust Programming Language book, also known as "the living book" is where I started seven years ago, but, it's had
seven years of growth, and its amazing.

The main difference between the book and IRISS is that the book focuses on how the language works, while IRISS focuses
on how its written.

We will talk about how the language works but only in the context of why we write it the way that we do.

IRISS does, however, follow a similar path to both the official book and Rustlings (our next resource), so it should be
easy to jump between all three.

### Rustlings

Rustlings is a "learn by doing" guide to Rust. It works by giving you specific exercises to help you understand the
language a bit at a time.

The gamification of the course makes it really fun, and I still use Rustlings to help keep myself sharp.

There is also an IntelliJ Edu adaptation of Rustlings so if you install the free Community version of IntelliJ IDEA, you
can have an in editor tutorial.


### Rust by Example

Rust by Example does exactly what it says on the tin.

It focuses on the implementation of the Rust language.

This is great to quickly look things up if you know what you want to know, however, there's some minor
pseudo-anti-patterns here that if you don't already know are anti-patterns, you might accidentally copy.

Don't worry though, we'll cover these here but also tools like Clippy (which we'll also cover) will be quick to point
them out.

### Idiomatic Rust in Simple Steps

So, why use IRISS if there are these other great resources?

Idiomatic Rust in Simple Steps lines up nicely with these other resources and can supplement them or vice versa. 

While the other resources focus on simply learning the language, IRISS focuses on how and why we write the language the
way we do. 

This might seem like the same thing, but here we'll ramp up on idioms quickly so that you can understand other peoples
code as well as write code that other people can understand.

This matters!

My biggest hot take of the software industry is that: Software engineers are not paid to write code, we're paid to
solve problems.

The best engineers I've worked with have solved problems without writing a single line of code, and the cheapest code to
maintain is the code you didn't write. 

Beyond this though, solving problems, even with code, takes understanding and collaboration. If when you join a team you
already understand why they write code the way they do, you're going to become productive much faster.


Whats Next
----------

In the next video we're going to cover, installing Rust, setting up your development environment and your first hello
world program.

I'm also going to teach you one neat trick that will super charge your learning and development skills!

If that's good bait, then I look forward to seeing you next time.
